- [x] Implement DynamoDB Schema
  - [x] Define table structure with PK: `PLACES#<search_type>` and SK: `VALUE#<search_value>`
  - [x] Add GSI1 for place_id lookups: `PLACE_ID#<place_id>` | `PLACE_ID#<place_id>`
  - [x] Store all Places API response fields as attributes
  - [x] Add metadata fields: last_updated, query_count

- [x] Create PlacesCache Class
  - [x] Implement getPlacesCache method for primary lookups
  - [x] Implement getPlacesCacheByPlaceId for secondary lookups

  - [x] Add cache invalidation logic based on last_updated

- [x] Modify PlacesAPI Class
  - [x] Add cache parameter to constructor
  - [x] Update search methods to check cache first:
    - [x] search_by_phone
    - [x] search_by_address
    - [x] search_nearby
    - [x] get_place_details
  - [x] Add intelligent cache storage:
    - [x] Skip caching for routes and non-business entities
    - [x] Handle missing place_ids gracefully
    - [x] Store full place details for reuse

- [x] Add Cache Monitoring
  - [x] Track cache hit/miss rates through logging
  - [x] Monitor query counts per cached item
  - [x] Add cache performance metrics
  - [x] Implement 30-day cache cleanup strategy
