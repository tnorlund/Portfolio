### Caching Google Places API
- [ ] Develop access patterns for DynamoDB look up
  - The Google Places response is unique per receipt in the image.
  - The look up should be based on what extracted data is found in the OCR results: (address, phone, URL)
- [ ] Implement DynamoDB Schema
  - [ ] Define table structure with PK: `IMAGE#<image_id>` and SK: `RECEIPT#<receipt_id>#PLACES#<search_type>#<search_value>`
  - [ ] Add GSI1 for place_id lookups: `PLACE_ID#<place_id>` | `IMAGE#<image_id>#RECEIPT#<receipt_id>`
  - [ ] Store all Places API response fields as attributes
  - [ ] Add metadata fields: last_updated, query_count, confidence_score
- [ ] Create PlacesAPICache Class
  - [ ] Implement get_places_response method for cache lookups
  - [ ] Implement save_places_response method for cache storage
  - [ ] Add cache invalidation logic based on last_updated
  - [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Modify PlacesAPI Class
  - [ ] Add cache parameter to constructor
  - [ ] Update search methods to check cache first:
    - [ ] search_by_phone
    - [ ] search_by_address
    - [ ] search_nearby
    - [ ] get_place_details
  - [ ] Add cache storage after successful API calls
- [ ] Update BatchPlacesProcessor
  - [ ] Integrate cache with process_receipt_batch
  - [ ] Add cache statistics tracking
  - [ ] Implement cache-based fallback strategies
- [ ] Add Cache Monitoring
  - [ ] Track cache hit/miss rates
  - [ ] Monitor cache size and growth
  - [ ] Add cache performance metrics
  - [ ] Implement cache cleanup strategy

### LayoutLM Dataset
- [ ] Data Preparation:
  - [ ] IOB format conversion
  - [ ] Bounding box normalization
  - [ ] Image feature generation
  - [ ] Dataset splitting
- [ ] Quality Assurance:
  - [ ] Label consistency checks
  - [ ] Validation UI
  - [ ] Inter-annotator agreement
  - [ ] Validation guidelines
