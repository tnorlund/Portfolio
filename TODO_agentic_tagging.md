# TODO: Enrich OCR Entity Labels via External API

## ‚úÖ Preparation

### Overall Coverage:
- Out of 265 total receipts, 264 (99.6%) had some form of extractable data
- Only 1 receipt (0.4%) had no extractable data at all
- This suggests the OCR system is very effective at finding structured data

### Most Common Combinations:
- The most comprehensive combination (address + date + phone + url) appears in 166 receipts (62.6%)
- The second most common is (address + date + phone) in 64 receipts (24.2%)
- Together, these two combinations cover 86.8% of all receipts, indicating most receipts have at least 3-4 types of data

### Distribution by Combinations:
- Full combination (4 types): 166 receipts (62.6%)
- Three types: 79 receipts (29.9%) total
  - address + date + phone: 64 (24.2%)
  - date + phone + url: 14 (5.3%)
  - address + date + url: 1 (0.4%)
- Two types: 12 receipts (4.5%) total
  - address + phone: 4 (1.5%)
  - date + phone: 4 (1.5%)
  - address + date: 3 (1.1%)
  - address + url: 1 (0.4%)
- Single type: 7 receipts (2.8%) total
  - address: 2 (0.8%)
  - phone: 2 (0.8%)
  - url: 2 (0.8%)
  - date: 1 (0.4%)

### Key Performance Insights:
- System achieves 83.0% successful match rate
- 81.5% of matches are high confidence
- 18.1% require manual review
- Primary validation relies on address and phone number matching
- Generic business types (street_address, route, department_store) dominate results
