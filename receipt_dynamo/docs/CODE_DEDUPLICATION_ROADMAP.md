#### Batch 5: Job & Infrastructure Entities (Week 3, PR #172)
- [ ] `_job.py` - Job management
- [ ] `_job_checkpoint.py` - Checkpoint operations
- [ ] `_job_dependency.py` - Dependency tracking
- [ ] `_job_log.py` - Logging operations
- [ ] `_job_metric.py` - Metrics tracking
- [ ] `_job_resource.py` - Resource management
- [ ] `_ocr_job.py` - OCR job operations
- [ ] `_batch_summary.py` - Batch operations
- [ ] `_cluster.py` - Cluster management
- [ ] `_instance.py` - Instance operations
- [ ] `_queue.py` - Queue operations
- [ ] `_places_cache.py` - Places caching
- [ ] `_label_count_cache.py` - Label count caching

### Phase 3: Optimization & Patterns (Week 4, PR #173)
**Goal**: Extract additional patterns and optimize further

1. **Query Pattern Extraction**
   - [ ] Create QueryBuilderMixin for complex queries
   - [ ] Standardize pagination patterns
   - [ ] Create IndexQueryMixin for GSI operations

2. **Caching Pattern Implementation**
   - [ ] Create CachingMixin for cache operations
   - [ ] Standardize TTL handling
   - [ ] Implement cache invalidation patterns

3. **Bulk Operation Optimization**
   - [ ] Create BulkQueryMixin for efficient bulk reads
   - [ ] Optimize batch write chunk sizes
   - [ ] Implement parallel processing where applicable

4. **Error Recovery Patterns**
   - [ ] Create RetryStrategyMixin for custom retry logic
   - [ ] Implement circuit breaker patterns
   - [ ] Add exponential backoff configurations

### Phase 4: Documentation & Training (Week 5, PR #174)
**Goal**: Ensure team adoption and maintainability

1. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create developer guide for using base operations
   - [ ] Document all mixins and their use cases
   - [ ] Create migration guide for new entities
   - [ ] Add code examples for common patterns

2. **Training Materials**
   - [ ] Create video walkthrough of the new architecture
   - [ ] Develop hands-on exercises
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

3. **Code Standards**
   - [ ] Update coding standards to require base operations
   - [ ] Create linting rules for pattern compliance
   - [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for validation

### Phase 5: Metrics & Validation (Week 6, PR #175)
**Goal**: Measure success and ensure quality

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - [ ] Run final pylint analysis
   - [ ] Calculate total code reduction
   - [ ] Measure test coverage improvements
   - [ ] Performance benchmark comparisons

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - [ ] Full regression testing
   - [ ] Performance testing under load
   - [ ] Security audit of new patterns
   - [ ] Code review by senior engineers

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Code Reduction**: Target 70%+ across all files
- **Duplicate Issues**: Reduce R0801 from 922 to <50
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 90%+ coverage
- **Performance**: No degradation in benchmarks

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Maintainability**: Easier to add new features
- **Consistency**: Uniform error handling across all operations
- **Debuggability**: Centralized logging and error tracking
- **Team Adoption**: All developers comfortable with new patterns

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Breaking Changes**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive integration tests
   - Fallback: Feature flags for gradual rollout

2. **Performance Regression**
   - Mitigation: Benchmark before/after each batch
   - Fallback: Optimize hot paths individually

3. **Hidden Dependencies**
   - Mitigation: Careful analysis of each file
   - Fallback: Maintain compatibility layer

### Process Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict batch boundaries
   - Fallback: Defer optimizations to Phase 3

2. **Team Resistance**
   - Mitigation: Early involvement and training
   - Fallback: Gradual adoption with champions

## Dependencies
- PR #165 must be merged before starting Phase 2
- No infrastructure changes required
- No external team dependencies

## Timeline Summary
- **Total Duration**: 6 weeks
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete
- **Phase 2**: Weeks 1-3 (Entity Migration)
- **Phase 3**: Week 4 (Optimization)
- **Phase 4**: Week 5 (Documentation)
- **Phase 5**: Week 6 (Validation)

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Get PR #165 reviewed and merged
2. Create feature branch for Batch 1 entities
3. Start with `_image.py` as the simplest case
4. Use `_receipt_refactored.py` as the template

## Long-term Vision
After completing all phases:
1. Apply similar patterns to other packages (receipt_label, receipt_ocr)
2. Create a company-wide library for DynamoDB operations
3. Open-source the base operations framework
4. Write blog post about the 80%+ code reduction achievement
