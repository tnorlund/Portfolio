fix: implement single source of truth for package versioning

This commit establishes a centralized versioning approach to solve circular
import problems and ensure version consistency across the codebase:

- Create dedicated version.py file as the single source of truth for package version
- Fix circular import issues in MetadataMixin by using explicit imports from version.py
- Add MetadataMixin to analysis classes to ensure consistent version handling
- Modify setup.py to extract version from version.py without importing it
- Create update_version.py utility to synchronize version across package files
- Update README.md with versioning documentation and instructions

This approach improves maintainability by:
1. Centralizing version definition in a single location
2. Providing a clear procedure for version updates
3. Eliminating potential version inconsistencies across the package
4. Resolving circular import issues that could prevent package initialization

The version now defaults to the package version for all analysis classes
through MetadataMixin, ensuring consistent version tracking that stays in
sync with package releases.
