      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I wanted to get better at using AI to automate tasks. I already use
        ChatGPT for everyday chores, but I wanted to use it on something more
        challenging: receipts. They may look deceptively simple, but each
        squeezes a lot of information into a tiny space, making it surprisingly
        difficult to decode.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Receipts?</h2>

      <p>
        Receipts are a difficult problem to solve. To turn a crumpled piece of
        paper into structured data, you have to read three layers of data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Text</strong>: The words on the receipt
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Layout</strong>: The layout of the receipt
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Meaning</strong>: The meaning of the words
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since these layers arrive in messy, mixed formats, receipts are an ideal
        test case for learning how to use AI to automate real-world tasks. The
        rest of this post describes how I disentangle those three layers and
        stitch the answers back together.
      </p>

      {/* 
      TODO: Fix OCR Section Disconnect - Show Visual Mess Before Technical Solution
      
      PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
      - Text jumps straight into technical solutions ("DBSCAN clustering, convex hull")
      - Visuals show perfect, clean geometric processing 
      - Missing the messy visual reality that creates the problem
      - No clear "why" for non-technical readers about why this clustering matters
      
      SOLUTION STRATEGY:
      Create a new flow that shows the mess first, then the solution:
      
      1. START WITH CHAOS: Show ReceiptStack (or similar) to demonstrate real-world receipt images:
         - Crumpled and wrinkled receipts
         - Photos taken at angles 
         - Multiple receipts overlapping in frame
         - Poor lighting conditions
         - Mixed with other objects/backgrounds
      
      2. EXPLAIN THE CONSEQUENCE: Without proper processing, text recognition gives:
         - Jumbled words with no grouping
         - Text from multiple receipts mixed together  
         - Wrong reading order
         - Background noise included as "receipt data"
      
      3. PRESENT SIMPLE SOLUTION: "The challenge isn't just reading text - it's figuring 
         out which words belong together"
      
      4. SHOW TECHNICAL SOLUTION WORKING: Current ScanReceiptBoundingBox and 
         PhotoReceiptBoundingBox visualizations now make sense as the "after"
      
      IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED:
      - Move ReceiptStack or create similar component showing messy input images
      - Rewrite intro text to be accessible (avoid OCR jargon)
      - Focus on "grouping text that belongs together" rather than geometric algorithms
      - Position existing visualizations as the successful "clean" result
      
      This makes "cleanest, most organized approach" meaningful because readers see 
      the chaotic starting point first.
      */}

      <h1>From Images to Words and Coordinates</h1>

      <p>
        Every receipt&apos;s journey begins as raw pixels, whether a crisp scan
        or a hastily snapped photo. But hidden within those pixels is structured
        information waiting to be extracted.
      </p>

      <ImageStack />

      <p>
        Text recognition finds words, but not context. Multiple receipts become
        one confusing jumble. The critical step: determining{" "}
        <strong>which words belong together</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Scans vs Photos</h2>
      <p>
        This is where the difference between <strong>scanned receipts</strong>{" "}
        and <strong>photographed receipts</strong> becomes crucial. Scans are
        the easy case: flat, well-lit, and aligned. But photos? They&apos;re
        captured at odd angles, under harsh store lighting, with shadows and
        curves that confuse even the best text recognition. Each type needs its
        own approach to group related words and separate one receipt from
        another.
      </p>

      <h2>Scans</h2>

      <p>
        With scans being the easier of the two, we can say that the receipt is
        parallel to the image sensor.
      </p>

      <ClientOnly>
        <ZDepthConstrained />
      </ClientOnly>

      <p>
        Grouping the scanned words is straightforward. Since the scanner
        captures everything flat and aligned, we can use simple rules: words
        that line up horizontally likely belong to the same line item, and
        everything on the page belongs to the same receipt. It&apos;s like
        reading a well-organized spreadsheet.
      </p>

      <ScanReceiptBoundingBox />
      <h2>Photos</h2>
      <p>
        Photos are trickier. When you snap a picture of a receipt on a counter,
        the camera captures it from an angle. Words at the top might appear
        smaller than words at the bottom. Lines that should be straight look
        curved. And if there are multiple receipts in frame? Now you need to
        figure out which words belong to which piece of paper.
      </p>

      <ClientOnly>
        <ZDepthUnconstrained />
      </ClientOnly>

      <p>
        To solve this puzzle, I look for clusters of words that seem to move
        together—like finding constellations in a sky full of stars. Words that
        are close together and follow similar patterns likely belong to the same
        receipt. Once identified, I can digitally &quot;flatten&quot; each
        receipt, making it as clean as a scan.
      </p>

      <PhotoReceiptBoundingBox />

      <h2>Making It Work at Scale</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we can group words correctly, we face a new challenge:
        processing thousands of receipts efficiently. My solution? My laptop
        handles the tricky word orientation while the cloud handles the visual
        processing (finding and flattening receipts).
      </p>

      <ClientOnly>
        <UploadDiagram chars={uploadDiagramChars} />
      </ClientOnly>

      <p>
        This hybrid approach has processed hundreds of receipts, transforming
        messy photos and scans into organized, searchable data:
      </p>

      <ReceiptStack />

      <div
        style={{
          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "space-around",
          marginTop: "3rem",
          marginBottom: "3rem",
          flexWrap: "wrap",
          gap: "2rem",
        }}
      >
        <ClientImageCounts />
        <ClientReceiptCounts />
      </div>

      <h1>Semantic Labeling</h1>
      <p>
        In order to explain the text on the receipt, I needed to explain how the
        words semantically relate to one another. But before I can explain, we
        have to understand what embedding is.
      </p>
      <h2>Embedding</h2>
      <p>
        I had never used embeddings before. They are not exactly new, but they
        have become widely available in the last few years. What embeddings
        offer is{" "}
        <i>
          the ability to discover connections between things at previously
          impossible scales.
        </i>{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone were to ask you to embed something, what do you need? You
        start with textual representation of the thing they&apos;re asking to
        embed.
      </p>

      <p>What do you get back? You get a structure of numbers.</p>

      <ClientOnly>
        <EmbeddingExample />
      </ClientOnly>

      <p>
        While each input might be different, we get the same structure of
        numbers back. Here&apos;s the magic. Because we get the same structure,
        we have a way to mathematically compare two pieces of text together. But
        what do the numbers mean?
      </p>
      <h3>How To Literally Embed</h3>
      <p>
        There are many services that offer to generate embeddings, but I ended
        up going with OpenAI.

      <ClientOnly>
        <AnimatedInView>
          <OpenAILogo />
        </AnimatedInView>
      </ClientOnly>
      <h3>Is It Expensive?</h3>
      <p>
        No. I experimented <i>a lot</i>. I developed a way to batch embeddings
        to cut costs further. This part is also free.
      </p>
      <h3>But What Do The Numbers Actually Mean?</h3>
      <p>
        So back to the question: what do the numbers mean? Let&apos;s think
        about coordinates on a map. Suppose I give you three points:
      </p>
      <table style={{ margin: "0 auto", borderCollapse: "collapse" }}>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th style={{ padding: "8px 16px", borderBottom: "1px solid #ddd" }}>
              Point
            </th>
            <th
              style={{
                padding: "8px 16px",
                borderBottom: "1px solid #ddd",
                textAlign: "right",
              }}
            >
              X
            </th>
            <th
              style={{
                padding: "8px 16px",
                borderBottom: "1px solid #ddd",
                textAlign: "right",
              }}
            >
              Y
            </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style={{ padding: "8px 16px" }}>A</td>
            <td style={{ padding: "8px 16px", textAlign: "right" }}>{"3"}</td>
            <td style={{ padding: "8px 16px", textAlign: "right" }}>{"2"}</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style={{ padding: "8px 16px" }}>B</td>
            <td style={{ padding: "8px 16px", textAlign: "right" }}>{"1"}</td>
            <td style={{ padding: "8px 16px", textAlign: "right" }}>{"1"}</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style={{ padding: "8px 16px" }}>C</td>
            <td style={{ padding: "8px 16px", textAlign: "right" }}>{"-2"}</td>
            <td style={{ padding: "8px 16px", textAlign: "right" }}>{"-2"}</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        There are 2 dimensions to this map: X and Y. Each point lives at the
        intersection of an X and Y coordinate.
      </p>
      <p>Is A closer to B or C?</p>

      <EmbeddingCoordinate />

      <p>A is closer to B.</p>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s the mental leap.{" "}
        <i>Embeddings are similar to points on a map.</i> Each number in the
        embedding is a coordinate in a complicated map. When OpenAI sends a list
        of numbers, it&apos;s telling you where that text <i>semantically</i>{" "}
        lives in that map. When we ask what the distance between two embeddings
        are, what we&apos;re really doing is asking how semantically close or
        far apart two pieces of text are.
      </p>
      <p>
        This concept of positioning items in multi-dimensional space like this,
        where related items are clustevar(--color-red) near each other, goes by
        the name of <strong>latent space</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Latent space is a powerful concept. It allows us to discover connections
        between things at previously impossible scales.
      </p>
      <h2>Scaling and Optimizing Latent Space</h2>
      <p>
        Writing and reading these lists of numbers get&apos;s complicated fast.
        After some research, I found Pinecone, a vector database that allows me
        to store and retrieve embeddings.
      </p>
      <ClientOnly>
        <AnimatedInView>
          <PineconeLogo />
        </AnimatedInView>
      </ClientOnly>
      <p>
        Pinecone&apos;s real strength shows when you attach <i>meaningful</i>
        information to each embedding. The embedding by itself can telling you
        which words are similar, but adding context, store name, location, or
        even category, let&apos;s you find the semantically similar words
        you&apos;re looking for.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaningful Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine looking for the word &quot;latte&quot; across 10,000 receipts.
        Without context, you&apos;ll get results from latte
        flavovar(--color-red) cereal at grocery stores, expensive drinks at
        coffee shops, and even brown colovar(--color-red) paint from hardware
        stores.
      </p>
      <p>
        With context, you can filter out the results that don&apos;t make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used OpenAI&apos;s Agents SDK with the Google Places API to get the
        context needed for rich, semantic search.

      <h2>Turning Semantic Search into Autonomous Labeling</h2>
      <p>
        Pinecone doesn&apos;t just help me <i>find</i> similar words, it allows
        me to act on them. After every receipt is embedded, an OpenAI agent
        retrieves the &quot;nearest neighbors&quot; of each unlabeled word,
        filtevar(--color-red) by the receipt&apos;s merchant-specific metadata.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the token &quot;latte&quot; on a Starbucks receipt, an agent pulls
        semantically similar words from other Starbucks receipts and asks:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &quot;Given these examples and surrounding words, what label would best
        describe <strong>latte</strong>?&quot;
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The agent then validates the proposed label using custom rules, similar
        examples where the word is correctly labeled with that label, and
        examples where the word is incorrectly labeled.
      </p>

      <LabelValidationCount />

      <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
      <p>
        This process is repeated to continuously improve the accuracy of the
        labels. As part of this loop, I use <strong>RAGAS</strong> to evaluate
        how faithful and relevant the model&apos;s responses are to the
        retrieved context.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <h2>Moving Fast and Breaking Things</h2>
      <p>
        This project was a great learning experience. The best way for me to
        learn is by actually doing. Experimenting with different tools and
        techniques allowed me to reflect on what worked and what didn&apos;t.
      </p>
      <p>I used Github and Pulumi to manage the cloud and code.</p>

        I got my build time down to ~10 seconds. This allows me to make a change
        locally and get feedback in seconds. Github allows me to track my
        changes and deploy to production.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m using React to build the frontend. It&apos;s a great way to get
        started, but I wanted to continue to increase my tech stack. I ended up
        porting to NextJS.

      <p>
        Moving to NextJS was really easy. Using a combination of Cursor and
        OpenAI&apos;s Codex allowed me to move this from one framework to
        another with minimal effort.

      <h2>Training a Custom Model</h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m currently training a custom model to improve the process of
        getting an image and structuring the data. Having to query a database of
        similar words works for large datasets, but there&apos;s room here for a
        simple model that can run on my laptop. I&apos;ve been playing with a
        few models on Hugging Face. Hugging Face.

      <h2>A New Era of Coding</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is advancing quickly and changing how we write
        software. However, no matter how smart computers become, we still need
        solid engineering practices, clever problem-solving, and expert
        knowledge. I&apos;m excited to see a future where people and AI work
        together to make programming faster, smarter, and easier for everyone.
