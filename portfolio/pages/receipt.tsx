      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I wanted to get better at using AI to automate tasks. I already use
        ChatGPT for everyday chores, but I wanted to use it on something more
        challenging: receipts. They may look deceptively simple, but each
        squeezes a lot of information into a tiny space, making it surprisingly
        difficult to decode.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Receipts?</h2>

      <p>
        Receipts are a difficult problem to solve. To turn a crumpled piece of
        paper into structured data, you have to read three layers of data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Text</strong>: The words on the receipt
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Layout</strong>: The layout of the receipt
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Meaning</strong>: The meaning of the words
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since these layers arrive in messy, mixed formats, receipts are an ideal
        test case for learning how to use AI to automate real-world tasks. The
        rest of this post describes how I disentangle those three layers and
        stitch the answers back together.
      </p>

      {/* 
      TODO: Fix OCR Section Disconnect - Show Visual Mess Before Technical Solution
      
      PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
      - Text jumps straight into technical solutions ("DBSCAN clustering, convex hull")
      - Visuals show perfect, clean geometric processing 
      - Missing the messy visual reality that creates the problem
      - No clear "why" for non-technical readers about why this clustering matters
      
      SOLUTION STRATEGY:
      Create a new flow that shows the mess first, then the solution:
      
      1. START WITH CHAOS: Show ReceiptStack (or similar) to demonstrate real-world receipt images:
         - Crumpled and wrinkled receipts
         - Photos taken at angles 
         - Multiple receipts overlapping in frame
         - Poor lighting conditions
         - Mixed with other objects/backgrounds
      
      2. EXPLAIN THE CONSEQUENCE: Without proper processing, text recognition gives:
         - Jumbled words with no grouping
         - Text from multiple receipts mixed together  
         - Wrong reading order
         - Background noise included as "receipt data"
      
      3. PRESENT SIMPLE SOLUTION: "The challenge isn't just reading text - it's figuring 
         out which words belong together"
      
      4. SHOW TECHNICAL SOLUTION WORKING: Current ScanReceiptBoundingBox and 
         PhotoReceiptBoundingBox visualizations now make sense as the "after"
      
      IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED:
      - Move ReceiptStack or create similar component showing messy input images
      - Rewrite intro text to be accessible (avoid OCR jargon)
      - Focus on "grouping text that belongs together" rather than geometric algorithms
      - Position existing visualizations as the successful "clean" result
      
      This makes "cleanest, most organized approach" meaningful because readers see 
      the chaotic starting point first.
      */}

      <h1>From Images to Words and Coordinates</h1>

      <p>
        Every receipt&apos;s journey begins as raw pixels, whether a crisp scan
        or a hastily snapped photo. But hidden within those pixels is structured
        information waiting to be extracted.
      </p>

      <ImageStack />

      <p>
        Text recognition finds words, but not context. Multiple receipts become
        one confusing jumble. The critical step: determining{" "}
        <strong>which words belong together</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Scans vs Photos</h2>
      <p>
        This is where the difference between <strong>scanned receipts</strong>{" "}
        and <strong>photographed receipts</strong> becomes crucial. Scans are
        the easy case: flat, well-lit, and aligned. But photos? They&apos;re
        captured at odd angles, under harsh store lighting, with shadows and
        curves that confuse even the best text recognition. Each type needs its
        own approach to group related words and separate one receipt from
        another.
      </p>

      <h2>Scans</h2>

      <p>
        With scans being the easier of the two, we can say that the receipt is
        parallel to the image sensor.
      </p>

      <ClientOnly>
        <ZDepthConstrained />
      </ClientOnly>

      <p>
        Grouping the scanned words is straightforward. Since the scanner
        captures everything flat and aligned, we can use simple rules: words
        that line up horizontally likely belong to the same line item, and
        everything on the page belongs to the same receipt. It&apos;s like
        reading a well-organized spreadsheet.
      </p>

      <ScanReceiptBoundingBox />
      <h2>Photos</h2>
      <p>
        Photos are trickier. When you snap a picture of a receipt on a counter,
        the camera captures it from an angle. Words at the top might appear
        smaller than words at the bottom. Lines that should be straight look
        curved. And if there are multiple receipts in frame? Now you need to
        figure out which words belong to which piece of paper.
      </p>

      <ClientOnly>
        <ZDepthUnconstrained />
      </ClientOnly>

      <p>
        To solve this puzzle, I look for clusters of words that seem to move
        together—like finding constellations in a sky full of stars. Words that
        are close together and follow similar patterns likely belong to the same
        receipt. Once identified, I can digitally &quot;flatten&quot; each
        receipt, making it as clean as a scan.
      </p>

      <PhotoReceiptBoundingBox />

      <h2>Making It Work at Scale</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we can group words correctly, we face a new challenge:
        processing thousands of receipts efficiently. My solution? My laptop
        handles the tricky word orientation while the cloud handles the visual
        processing (finding and flattening receipts).
      </p>

        <UploadDiagram chars={uploadDiagramChars} />

      <p>
        This hybrid approach has processed hundreds of receipts, transforming
        messy photos and scans into organized, searchable data:
      </p>

      <ReceiptStack />

      <div

          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "space-around",

          marginBottom: "3rem",
          flexWrap: "wrap",
          gap: "2rem",
        }}

        <ClientImageCounts />
        <ClientReceiptCounts />
      </div>

      <h2>Semantic Understanding</h2>

      <p>
        I&apos;ve found that these &ldquo;AI agents&rdquo; are pretty dumb on
        their own: the meme is a dumb intern that needs more information to
        figure out how to do the job. Retrieval-Augmented Generation gives the
        intern a window of context through a set of tools, but the answers can
        still be non-deterministic. The fix is to encode the data so the
        retrieval is precise and learning is repeatable.
      </p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>
        One of the best tools I&apos;ve found has been semantic search. I found
        the best way I can understand it is this example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>King is to queen as man is to woman</blockquote>
      <p>
        This shows how king and queen have a similar meaning as man and woman
        (gender). This relationship is semantically explained by embeddings,
        which place related words near each other.
      </p>
      <p>I embed the words with OpenAI.</p>
      <ClientOnly>
        <AnimatedInView>
          <OpenAILogo />
        </AnimatedInView>
      </ClientOnly>
      <p>
        The relationships can be queried using a database like Chroma, and
        I&apos;ve been able to run it for less than a dollar a month using
        docker and Amazon&apos;s serverless service, Fargate.

          <DockerLogo />
        </AnimatedInView>
      </ClientOnly>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve also learned how powerful Google Maps is with very little
        information.

      </ClientOnly>

      <p>
        Once the receipt has the place it came from and the words are
        semantically comparable, these AI Agents can start labeling the data.
      </p>

      <h3>Enriching the Data</h3>

      <p>
        The dumb-intern still needs review. The data I get through Google Maps
        is disorganized. The Google Maps data is cleaned using entity
        resolution: build a small graph of merchants where the edges between
        them mean &ldquo;same phone,&rdquo; &ldquo;same address,&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;name similarity.&rdquo; Stronger signals (phone + address)
        outweigh weaker ones (name only). I pick a &ldquo;golden&rdquo; merchant
        in these clustered groups to ensure all receipts from a specific store
        have the most correct data.
      </p>
      <MerchantCount />

      <p>
        Next, I narrow the vocabulary to receipt words (totals, taxes, dates,
        phone, address). The AI Agent is given the definition per label and
        gives an initial guess. The Agent then validates the guess using the
        tools we spoke of earlier.
      </p>

        This technique not only gives the AI enough context to make the right
        decision but also helps it learn from its mistakes. This approach has
        allowed me to increase accuracy and use less compute and time.
      </p>

      <LabelValidationCount />

      <p>
        I&apos;ve been able to speed up the receipt labeling even further by
        using LayoutLM, a document understanding model that takes both text and
        layout into account. Trained on my agent-validated labels, it predicts a
        token, address, date, total, etc. in one forward pass. In production
        this gives me:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Speed & cost</strong>: cheap, local inference instead of
          repeated chat calls
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistency</strong>: probabilistic explanations vs.
          non-deterministic hallucinations
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Better validation</strong>: predicted labels + graph/rule
          checks catch mismatches fast
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To improve accuracy, I can add more receipts, synthesize new receipts by
        finding patterns within and outside of different merchants, and adding
        noise to existing receipts. This model learns from more data while
        poisoning the truth. This gives me consistent, repeatable predictions
        explaining what a receipt is.

        <h2>What&apos;s on the Receipts?</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;m still working on this part. My experience in data engineering
          gave me a great head start into structuring and organizing data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optimizing this has been fun. I&apos;ve learned a lot about open
          source models. I&apos;ve used Ollama to organize how I deploy the
          models and LangChain to explain how the models are using the tools.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>
        AI has made <i>typing</i> cheap, but the bottlenecks remain{" "}
        <i>understanding</i>, <i>testing</i>, <i>reviewing</i>, and{" "}
        <i>trusting</i>. By shifting my focus from typing code to testing,
        understanding, and architecting solutions, I prototype and experiment
        faster. I can talk to AI, try a new approach, and see my changes in the
        cloud. With a 10-second feedback loop and tests gate production deploys,
        I meet the no-downtime requirement while iterating quickly. I no longer
        spend most of my time researching how to accomplish the task, I just
        build it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;ve been able to iterate quickly using Pulumi&apos;s
        Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

      <p>
        This has allowed me to try something new <i>at scale</i> quickly. These
        cheap tries are allowing me to &ldquo;skill-max&ldquo; my cloud
        expertise.
      </p>

      <p>
        This rapid iteration with developer best practices allows me to
        prototype in a safe environment, review and test my changes, and ship
        with confidence using GitHub and Pulumi.

        Understanding how software works, testing to make sure it works, and
        trusting that changes don&apos;t break things still takes a long time.
        Prototyping and shipping to cloud to test new features in seconds speeds
        up development, makes learning fun, and allows me to focus on trying
        something new without being afraid of breaking things. I now optimize
        development loop speed, not keystrokes.
