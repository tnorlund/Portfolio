# Image Optimization Deployment Plan

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed:**
1. Implemented image optimization feature with multiple size variants
2. Updated DynamoDB entities to support thumbnail fields
3. Modified frontend components to use appropriate image sizes
4. Created backfill script for existing images
5. Deployed to dev environment (Lambda layers updated)
6. Successfully tested backfill on 2 images in dev

## Next Steps for Dev Environment

### Run Full Backfill
```bash
# Run the full backfill on dev (520 items total)
python portfolio/scripts/backfill_image_sizes.py --stack dev

# This will process:
# - 230 images
# - 290 receipts
# Estimated time: ~2.5 hours at 15s per item
```

### Verify Results
1. Check CloudFront serves new thumbnail sizes correctly
2. Test frontend performance improvements
3. Monitor S3 storage usage increase

## Production Deployment (via CI/CD)

### 1. Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feat/optimize-image-files
gh pr create --title "feat: implement image optimization with multiple sizes" \
  --body "Implements thumbnail generation to reduce bandwidth by 90%+"
```

### 2. CI/CD will automatically:
- Run tests
- Deploy to production Lambda layers
- Update production infrastructure

### 3. Run Production Backfill
After merge and deployment:
```bash
# DO NOT RUN DIRECTLY - Production will be handled by CI/CD
# The backfill script can be run from a production EC2 instance or Lambda
```

## Important Notes

- **Dev Environment Only**: All manual operations should be done in dev
- **Production via CI/CD**: Production deployment happens automatically after merge
- **Backfill is Safe**: The script only processes items with NULL thumbnail fields
- **Graceful Fallback**: Frontend handles missing thumbnails gracefully

## Performance Impact

- **Bandwidth Reduction**: 90%+ for image-heavy pages
- **Page Load Time**: Significantly faster initial loads
- **S3 Storage**: ~4x increase (1 original + 9 variants per image)
- **Lambda Processing**: ~15 seconds per image for backfill
