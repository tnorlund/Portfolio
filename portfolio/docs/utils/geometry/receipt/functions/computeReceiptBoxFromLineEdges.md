# Function: computeReceiptBoxFromLineEdges()

> **computeReceiptBoxFromLineEdges**(`lines`, `hull`, `centroid`, `avgAngle`): [`Point`](../../basic/interfaces/Point.md)[]

Defined in: [utils/geometry/receipt.ts:216](https://github.com/tnorlund/Portfolio/blob/b52af8d8c0b4f3796b5bdff13b2662e5305f19bd/portfolio/utils/geometry/receipt.ts#L216)

Build a four‑point bounding box for a receipt based on estimated
line edges.

## Parameters

### lines

[`Line`](../../../../types/api/interfaces/Line.md)[]

OCR lines from which the edges are derived.

### hull

[`Point`](../../basic/interfaces/Point.md)[]

Convex hull of all line corners.

### centroid

[`Point`](../../basic/interfaces/Point.md)

Centroid of the hull.

### avgAngle

`number`

Average orientation of the lines in degrees.

## Returns

[`Point`](../../basic/interfaces/Point.md)[]

The receipt polygon defined in clockwise order. Returns an
empty array when no lines are supplied.
