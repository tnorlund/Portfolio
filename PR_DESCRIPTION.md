## ðŸš€ Deployment Notes

### CI Monitoring (Phase 1/4)
This PR establishes the foundation for comprehensive CI optimization. Future phases will include:
- **Phase 2**: Smart caching optimization (~487 lines)
- **Phase 3**: Test distribution optimization (~567 lines)  
- **Phase 4**: Advanced monitoring and recommendations (~1,000+ lines)

### Performance Monitoring
- Performance overlay available in development mode
- Core Web Vitals tracking enabled
- Bundle analysis available via `npm run analyze`

### Repository Cleanup
- Removed 29,667 lines of Lighthouse CI artifacts
- Removed 315 lines of Playwright test artifacts
- Added proper .gitignore entries to prevent future bloat

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

### Bundle Size Impact
- Performance monitoring utilities: ~2KB gzipped
- ImageStack optimizations: Reduced initial bundle size
- CI profiler: Minimal runtime impact (development tool)

### Core Web Vitals Improvements
- **LCP**: Improved via image preloading and lazy loading
- **FID**: Enhanced through optimized component rendering
- **CLS**: Stabilized with proper image aspect ratios

## ðŸ“· Screenshots

### Performance Overlay (Development)
Performance metrics overlay provides real-time Core Web Vitals monitoring during development.

### CI Performance Reports
Automated weekly CI performance reports track build times, system utilization, and performance trends.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
1. **ImageStack Component**: Lazy loading, format detection, preloading
2. **ReceiptStack Component**: Similar optimizations for receipt displays
3. **Performance Provider**: React context for performance data
4. **Performance Monitor Hook**: Custom hook for Core Web Vitals tracking

### CI Monitoring Infrastructure
1. **ci_profiler.py**: Basic system metrics collection (203 lines)
2. **ci-monitoring-basic.yml**: GitHub Actions workflow (115 lines)
3. **CI_MONITORING_BASIC.md**: Usage documentation (112 lines)

### Testing Framework
1. **Playwright Performance Tests**: E2E performance validation
2. **Jest Performance Tests**: Component performance testing
3. **Core Web Vitals Integration**: Automated performance assertions
