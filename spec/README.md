## 🎯 Current Focus

### **Next Sprint (Issue #122)**
**AI Usage Tracking Phase 5 - Production Deployment**
- Deploy complete AI usage tracking system to production
- Implement advanced analytics and reporting
- Achieve sub-100ms latency and 99.99% availability

### **Upcoming Work**
1. **Issue #147** - Google Places API context manager integration
2. **Issue #146** - Receipt upload package reformatting to match standards
3. **Agentic Refactor** - Long-term architectural transformation

### **Long-term Vision**
**Agentic Architecture Transformation** - Complete system refactor to agent-based architecture with:
- RAG-based intelligent labeling
- Standardized tool registry
- Real-time streaming capabilities
- Advanced observability
