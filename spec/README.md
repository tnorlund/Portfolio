## 📋 Acceptance Criteria Summary

### **Phase 2 (Issue #119) - Environment Configuration**
- ✅ Environment detection works automatically
- ✅ Table isolation prevents cross-environment data mixing
- ✅ Auto-tagging includes all required metadata
- ✅ Integration with existing AIUsageTracker

### **Resilience (Issue #130) - System Stress Handling**
- ✅ Maintains >10% throughput under simulated load
- ✅ Circuit breaker pattern for DynamoDB failures
- ✅ Exponential backoff retry logic
- ✅ Batch processing for rate limiting

### **Phase 3 (Issue #120) - Context Managers**
- ✅ Context automatically propagates to all AI calls
- ✅ Thread-safe for concurrent operations
- ✅ Performance impact < 5ms per operation

### **Phase 4 (Issue #121) - Cost Monitoring**
- ✅ Real-time cost tracking within 1% margin
- ✅ Alert delivery within 5 minutes of threshold breach
- ✅ Support for 1000+ concurrent budget tracking

### **Phase 5 (Issue #122) - Production Deployment**
- ✅ Sub-100ms tracking latency for 99th percentile
- ✅ Support for 10,000+ requests per second
- ✅ 99.99% availability SLA
