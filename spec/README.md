## 🎯 Current Focus

### **Next Sprint (Issue #120)**
**AI Usage Tracking Phase 3 - Context Manager Patterns**
- Implement context managers for automatic AI call tracking
- Thread-safe operation for concurrent requests
- Performance target: < 5ms overhead per operation

### **Upcoming Work**
1. **Issue #121** - Cost monitoring and alerting (Phase 4)
2. **Issue #122** - Production deployment (Phase 5)
3. **Issue #146** - Receipt upload package reformatting

### **Long-term Vision**
**Agentic Architecture Transformation** - Complete system refactor to agent-based architecture with:
- RAG-based intelligent labeling
- Standardized tool registry
- Real-time streaming capabilities
- Advanced observability
