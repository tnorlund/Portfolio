## 📊 Active Development Roadmap

| Specification | Status | Priority | GitHub Issue | Effort |
|---------------|--------|----------|--------------|---------|

## 🎯 Current Focus

### **🟡 ENHANCEMENT: Line Item Processing**
**The receipt_label package has functional but incomplete line item processing**
- Core labeling works (60-70% effective) but GPT enhancement is broken
- Missing GPT function that was never properly implemented
- 30-40% of receipts fail advanced processing for complex patterns

### **Unblocked Work**
1. **Issue #122** - AI Usage Tracking (can proceed - core labeling works)
2. **Issue #147** - Google Places API integration (can proceed)
3. **Issue #146** - Receipt upload reformatting (can proceed)

### **Enhancement Plan**
4-week enhancement plan to improve line item processing from 60-70% to 90-95% accuracy using pattern matching + Pinecone

### **Long-term Vision**
**Agentic Architecture Transformation** - Complete system refactor to agent-based architecture with:
- RAG-based intelligent labeling
- Standardized tool registry
- Real-time streaming capabilities
- Advanced observability
