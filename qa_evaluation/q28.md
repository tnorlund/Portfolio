## Agent Reasoning

The agent estimated **$489.34** on frozen foods across 15 receipts:
- **Wild Fork** (primary source, $438.89 total across 9 receipts): Chicken pot pie, short rib ravioli, boom boom shrimp, frozen pizzas, smoked salmon, etc.
- **Sprouts Farmers Market** ($19.97): Ice cream items (TOFFEE ICE CREAM BAR, LEMON CKIE ICE CREAM, MINT CHIP ICE CREAM).
- **Vons** ($15.48): CHUNKY MONKEY ($5.49), JENIS SPLENDED ICE ($9.99).

The agent correctly identified Wild Fork as a frozen food specialty store and called `get_receipt_summaries` to aggregate all Wild Fork spending.

## Shape

20 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**You spent a total of $517.28 on frozen foods.**

This breaks down as:
- **$78.39** on ice cream and ice cream bars from Vons and Sprouts Farmers Market
- **$438.89** from Wild Fork (9 receipts; specialty frozen foods store)

## Evaluation

**Grade:** C+

**Correct Answer:** This is an inherently ambiguous question. The answer depends on what counts as "frozen food." MCP verification confirms:

**Wild Fork ($438.89 across 9 receipts with totals):** Wild Fork is a frozen food specialty retailer. MCP `get_receipt_summaries` with merchant_filter="Wild Fork" returns 9 receipts, total_spending=$438.89. The 9th receipt (caf19581) has null grand_total. This portion is correctly included.

**Ice cream from other stores:** MCP `search_product_lines` for "ICE CREAM" returns 3 matches totaling $19.97:
- TOFFEE ICE CREAM BAR: $6.99 (Sprouts, 887079fa)
- LEMON CKIE ICE CREAM: $6.49 (Sprouts, 2c9b770c)
- MINT CHIP ICE CREAM: $6.49 (Sprouts, 2c9b770c)

**Other frozen items:** MCP `search_product_lines` for "DREYERS" returns 2 matches:
- DREYERS FR VAN IC: $6.49 each (Vons 678a7c94 and 2360d36e). However, these two receipts (678a7c94 and 2360d36e) are duplicate OCR scans of the same physical receipt -- same date (02/03/25), same items, same total ($61.13). Only one should be counted: $6.49.

**CHUNKY MONKEY:** MCP returns 1 match at $5.49 (Vons, 1b441d33). **JENIS SPLENDED ICE:** $9.99 on the same receipt.

**Corrected ice cream total (non-Wild Fork):** $6.49 (Dreyers, deduplicated) + $6.99 (Toffee bar) + $6.49 (Lemon) + $6.49 (Mint chip) + $5.49 (Chunky Monkey) + $9.99 (Jenis) = $41.94

**Best estimate total:** $438.89 (Wild Fork) + $41.94 (ice cream) = $480.83

**Tool Efficiency:** 16 calls (good). The agent used comprehensive text and semantic searches for frozen items, fetched 5 receipts for verification, and correctly used `get_receipt_summaries` to aggregate Wild Fork spending. The `list_merchants` call was useful for identifying Wild Fork as a frozen specialist.

**Issues:**
1. The synthesizer's $517.28 total has arithmetic errors in the ice cream portion. The evidence lists DREYERS at $13.48 (doubled) and CHUNKY MONKEY + JENIS at $31.46 (doubled). The actual prices from the receipts are $6.49 and $15.48 respectively. The $78.39 ice cream subtotal is inflated; the correct figure is approximately $41.94.
2. The duplicate Vons receipts (678a7c94 and 2360d36e) are counted separately in the evidence, doubling the Dreyers ice cream.
3. The synthesizer did correctly include Wild Fork aggregate at $438.89, which is the major component.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
- **Significant improvement.** The baseline synthesizer produced $64.91 (ice cream only), completely excluding Wild Fork and claiming it "lacks item details." The hybrid shaping fix now correctly includes Wild Fork's $438.89 total, which is the largest component.
- The agent reasoning was preserved: the synthesizer built upon the agent's Wild Fork identification rather than contradicting it.
- 20 receipts were shaped (vs. 12 in baseline), providing better coverage.
- The total ($517.28) is in the right ballpark, though inflated by ~$36 due to duplicate counting of ice cream items. The baseline answer of $64.91 was off by roughly $400+.
- Grade improved from D to C+ (correct Wild Fork identification and inclusion, but arithmetic errors in the ice cream component prevent a higher grade).
