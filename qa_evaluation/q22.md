Your average monthly spending is approximately $3,654. Based on total spending of $175,415.91 across 479 receipts with recorded totals (out of 589 total). Data spans roughly 48 months (October 2022 to September 2026). Notes that spending varies due to outliers like Home Depot ($3,000-$10,000) and possible non-consumer transactions (Chase Bank $16,000-$25,000). Average per receipt: $366.21.

## Final Answer

**Insufficient data to compute a precise monthly spending average.**

The provided receipt data spans dates from as early as 2016-01-17 (Target) to 2025-11-16 (Starbucks), covering roughly 10 years (~120 months). However, many receipts lack dates, totals, or usable details. Across all 589 receipts, total spending is **$175,415.91**, for an average of **$366.21 per receipt**. A rough estimate over ~120 months would be ~**$1,462/month**, but this is unreliable due to irregular date coverage (most receipts appear 2024-2025) and outliers like large Home Depot purchases ($10,405.87, $3,792.07).

## Evaluation

**Grade:** C

**Correct Answer:** Total spending across all receipts is $175,415.91 across 589 receipts (479 with totals). The average per receipt is $366.21. The agent's internal reasoning estimate of ~$3,654/month (over 48 active months) or ~$7,300/month (over 24 months of regular activity) are reasonable estimates depending on interpretation. The synthesize step's ~$1,462/month (over 120 months) is also mathematically valid but assumes even distribution over 10 years, which is misleading given sparse early data.

**Tool Efficiency:** 1 call (optimal -- single `get_receipt_summaries` with no filters is the correct approach)

**Issues:**
1. The agent's internal reasoning (Step 4) calculated ~$3,654/month over 48 months, which is a reasonable estimate. But the synthesize step recalculated to ~$1,462/month over 120 months using the earliest date (2016), which spans a much wider period with very sparse early data.
2. The final answer hedges by saying "insufficient data" when the agent already had enough data in its reasoning to provide a useful estimate. The agent's reasoning correctly identified that most activity is concentrated in 2024-2025.
3. The two estimates ($3,654/month from reasoning vs $1,462/month from synthesis) are both presented or implied, creating confusion. The $1,462 figure is technically correct over 120 months but misleading as a "monthly average" when most spending occurred in the last 2 years.
4. The total spending of $175,415.91 is correctly reported and consistent between reasoning and final answer.
5. The outlier concern (Home Depot $10,405.87) is valid and appropriately noted.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
- Major improvement: the final answer now preserves the total spending figure ($175,415.91) and provides a monthly estimate (~$1,462/month), whereas the baseline's final answer said "cannot be calculated" and reported only $100.80 across 4 receipts.
- 200 receipts were shaped (vs 4 in baseline), dramatically better data preservation through the pipeline.
- The total spending and average per receipt figures are now correctly carried through to the final answer.
- However, there is still a disconnect: the agent's reasoning estimated ~$3,654/month (reasonable for the active period), but the synthesize step diluted this to ~$1,462/month by spanning the full 10-year range. This is better than the baseline's complete data loss but still represents a reasoning degradation in the synthesize step.
- Grade improved from F to C: the answer is now factually grounded with correct aggregate data, even if the monthly estimate methodology could be better.
