## Agent Reasoning

**Your food spending over the past 6-12 months (primarily March 2024 to November 2025, based on receipt dates) shows a steady trend, averaging ~$30-40 per receipt across ~350 food-related receipts totaling $10,741 (including $6,581 at grocery stores like Sprouts Farmers Market and $3,850 at restaurants/dining).**

### Key Insights:
- **Grocery dominant (60-65% of spending)**: 224+ receipts at Sprouts (194 receipts), Vons, Target Grocery, Trader Joe's, Costco/Wild Fork, totaling $6,581-$6,634. Average receipt $29-30.
- **Dining out (30-35%)**: 108 receipts at restaurants (In-N-Out, Urbane Cafe, Mastro's, Italia Deli, etc.), totaling $3,850. Average $39/receipt. Mix of quick meals ($10-20) and occasional splurges ($100-300).
- **Trend**: Consistent volume (20-40 receipts/month), no sharp increases/decreases visible. Peaks in summer/fall 2025 (more dining), steady groceries year-round. Total tax paid ~$2,343; minimal tips ($3.74).
- **Top merchants**: Sprouts (majority groceries), In-N-Out/Roast & Rice (dining), Wild Fork (bulk).

## Final Answer

**Your food spending trend over the past 6 months (approximated as June-November 2025 using dated receipts) shows consistent, frequent grocery purchases (primarily at Sprouts Farmers Market, averaging ~$20-50 per trip, multiple times per month) dominating at ~60-70% of activity, alongside variable restaurant/dining out spending with spikes from occasional high-end meals.**

**Overall food totals across all receipts (spanning ~2022-2025): $10,740.54 (353 receipts, avg $31.68/receipt). Breakdown:**
- Groceries/grocery stores: $6,634.30 (227 receipts, avg $29.62/receipt) -- steady trend
- Restaurants/dining: $3,850.19 (108 receipts, avg $39.29/receipt) -- spiky

**Recent 6-month highlights (Jun-Nov 2025 dated receipts only):**

| Month | Grocery total (ex.) | Restaurant total (ex.) | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Jun 2025 | ~$150+ (multiple Sprouts) | ~$440 (high volume) | Steady groceries; busy dining. |
| Jul 2025 | ~$100+ (Sprouts) | ~$630 (peaks) | Luxury spikes (Sun Nong Dan, Mastro's). |
| Aug 2025 | ~$50+ | ~$15 | Low dining. |
| Sep 2025 | ~$100+ | ~$50 | Steady low. |
| Oct 2025 | ~$50+ | ~$80 | Balanced. |
| Nov 2025 | ~$35+ | ~$60 | Ongoing. |

**Trend summary:** No sharp upward/downward trajectory; groceries stable (~$200-400/month est.), restaurants fluctuate ($50-600+/month) driven by 1-2 big outings.

## Evaluation

**Grade:** B-

**Correct Answer:** Verified totals from MCP tools:
- Grocery store category: 224+ receipts (full count exceeds output limit), total in the thousands
- Restaurant category: 108 receipts, $3,850.19 total, avg $39.29/receipt
- The agent's claimed totals ($6,634.30 groceries, $3,850.19 restaurants) are consistent with the data. The restaurant total of $3,850.19 is independently confirmed.

The agent correctly identified the spending pattern: groceries dominate (60-65%), restaurants are variable with occasional large outliers (Sun Nong Dan $348.94, Mastro's $294.13).

**Tool Efficiency:** 6 calls (efficient -- list_categories, list_merchants, and 4 get_receipt_summaries calls for grocery_store, restaurant, grocery, and food categories)

**Issues:**
1. The monthly breakdown table uses approximate/estimated figures ("~$150+", "~$100+") rather than exact sums. This is noted in the answer but reduces precision. The "+" suffix and approximate ranges indicate the agent is aware of undated receipt limitations.
2. Null-date receipts likely inflate per-month totals when using date filters (the baseline evaluation noted this). The hybrid version avoids per-month queries entirely, using overall totals + dated receipt observations, which is actually a better approach.
3. The synthesizer's monthly table appears to be rough estimates derived from shaped receipt data rather than computed aggregates, which reduces confidence in the month-by-month numbers.
4. Some data quality issues go unmentioned: duplicate receipts across images, OCR errors in amounts (e.g., bacon at $1,798).

**Improvements from Baseline:**
- **Critical fix: The synthesizer no longer contradicts the agent.** The baseline gave an F because the agent reasoning discussed monthly trends with specific numbers, but the synthesizer then claimed "no dates or timestamps are included on any receipts" and reported only $484.47 across 17 receipts. This was a catastrophic data loss caused by the old shaping approach that only passed 18 receipts to the synthesizer.
- The hybrid version shaped 200 receipts (up from 18 in baseline), and the synthesizer now produces a coherent answer that aligns with the agent reasoning: $10,740 total across 353 receipts, with a grocery/restaurant split and monthly approximations.
- The final answer now correctly acknowledges dates exist and uses them to construct a 6-month trend table, rather than falsely claiming no dates are available.
- The overall totals ($6,634.30 groceries, $3,850.19 restaurants) are consistent between agent reasoning and final answer.
- Grade improved dramatically from F to B- because the answer is now factually accurate, internally consistent, and provides a reasonable trend analysis. The remaining issues are about precision (approximate monthly figures) rather than fundamental correctness.
