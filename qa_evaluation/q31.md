## Agent Reasoning

### Agent Step 3 (13000ms)

No receipts contain explicit text matching "handwritten notes" or similar terms (text searches returned 0 results). Semantic searches (low confidence, ~0.3-0.4 similarity) primarily matched printed "NOTE" sections or unrelated text like dates/names in In-N-Out Burger and other receipts.

Potential candidates with "NOTE" followed by unlabeled/odd text (possibly OCR of scribbles/handwriting):

- **In-N-Out Burger** (image_id: `0fca7cfd-183e-4109-87a9-2b7b7b94e82d`, receipt_id: 1): Line 7: NOTE; Li...

## Final Answer

**Receipts with indications of handwritten notes:**

- **Nordstrom (Receipt 4, ID: 9983a3fc-ad3c-421b-9968-1d4e9c687409:1)**: Contains "NORD NOTE 1070 M" item for $11.00, likely a handwritten note.
- **In-N-Out Burger (Receipt 3, ID: 0fca7cfd-183e-4109-87a9-2b7b7b94e82d:1)**: Contains "Cashier: ORDERTAKEN" item for $1.00, suggestive of a handwritten annotation.

No explicit handwritten notes are described on other receipts. Irregular items (e.g., varying meat patty prices or $235.00 fries on Receipt 1) may indicate custom handwritten orders but are not labeled as notes.

**Evidence:**
```json
[
  {
    "image_id": "9983a3fc-ad3c-421b-9968-1d4e9c687409",
    "receipt_id": "1",
    "item": "NORD NOTE 1070 M",
    "amount": "$11.00"
  },
  {
    "image_id": "0fca7cfd-183e-4109-87a9-2b7b7b94e82d",
    "receipt_id": "1",
    "item": "Cashier: ORDERTAKEN",
    "amount": "$1.00"
  }
]
```

## Evaluation

**Grade:** C

**Correct Answer:** This question is fundamentally unanswerable from OCR data. OCR captures text content but cannot distinguish handwritten text from printed text. No receipts contain the literal word "handwritten" or any metadata indicating handwriting. The word "NOTE" appears on 8 receipts across 2 merchants, but in every case it refers to standard printed receipt fields: (1) In-N-Out Burger uses "NOTE" as a drive-through order label (followed by a car description like "tesla"), and (2) Nordstrom uses "NORD NOTE 1070 M" to reference a Nordstrom Note gift card / payment method. Neither represents a handwritten note.

**Tool Efficiency:** 14 calls -- adequate but slightly high. The agent used 3 semantic searches (handwritten notes, handwritten annotation, handwritten memo) and 5 text searches (handwritten, notes, annotation, memo, handwritten note), then 6 get_receipt calls. The text and semantic search coverage was thorough but the three near-synonym semantic searches (notes/annotation/memo) were redundant given how semantic search works. Could have been done in ~10 calls.

**Issues:**
- The agent's final answer incorrectly presents two candidates as likely handwritten notes: "NORD NOTE 1070 M" (a Nordstrom gift card payment) and "Cashier: ORDERTAKEN" (a standard In-N-Out printed field). Neither is a handwritten note.
- The agent failed to recognize that "NORD NOTE" is a Nordstrom Note (payment/gift card). The receipt itself shows "NORD NOTE 1070 BALANCE: 0.00" on line 19, making it clear this is a payment instrument.
- The agent mischaracterized "Cashier: ORDERTAKEN" as a $1.00 item suggestive of a handwritten annotation. This is a standard cashier identifier field, not a product or note.
- The agent did not explicitly state that the question is unanswerable from OCR data, which would have been the most accurate and useful response.
- The agent's reasoning (step 3) correctly noted that text searches returned 0 results and semantic similarity was low (~0.3-0.4), but the final answer contradicted this caution by presenting speculative candidates as findings.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- When a question asks about physical properties of a receipt (handwritten vs. printed, ink color, paper condition, etc.), the agent should explicitly state that OCR data only captures text content and cannot detect these visual/physical attributes.
- The agent should investigate the context of "NOTE" matches more carefully before reporting them. Looking at the full Nordstrom receipt would reveal "NORD NOTE 1070 BALANCE: 0.00" clearly indicates a payment method, not handwriting.
- When all search results have very low confidence (similarity < 0.35), the agent should default to "no results found" rather than speculating on weak matches.
- Answering "I cannot determine this from the available data" is preferable to presenting incorrect candidates.
