## Final Answer

You spent **$63.88** on coffee this year across the following receipts:

## Evaluation

**Grade:** C+

**Correct Answer:** Depends on scope, but my independent verification found:

### Independent Verification

**Grocery coffee beans/grounds:**
| Item | Price | Merchant |
|------|-------|----------|
| ORG BIRCHWOOD COFFEE | $15.99 | Sprouts Farmers Market |
| FIO FRENCH ROAST COFFEE | $10.99 | Trader Joe's |
| KS ESPRESSO (beans) | $15.89 | Costco Wholesale |

**Cafe coffee drinks (verified in product line search):**
| Item | Price | Merchant |
|------|-------|----------|
| Drip Coffee | $5.50 | Sunrose California Eatery |
| Large Americano + Cappuccino | $10.00 | La La Land |
| Iced Latte + Iced Americano | $11.25 | Le Pain Quotidien |
| Pour Over | $5.25 | Blue Bottle Coffee |
| Large Americano | $4.80 | La La Land (ca7ea0eb) |
| Large House Coffee | $4.40 | La La Land Kind Cafe (409ea824) |

**Note:** The La La Land receipts at ca7ea0eb ($4.80 Americano) and 409ea824 ($4.40 House Coffee) appear in semantic search results but do not exist as full receipts in the database (get_receipt returns "not found"). Two additional La La Land receipts (b41971e7 and cd456f8c from the 4 total La La Land receipts) and any additional receipts from 2026 were not verified because the question asks about "this year" and the definition depends on when the agent ran.

**Totals:**
- Grocery beans/grounds only: $42.87
- Cafe drinks (confirmed): $36.40
- All confirmed coffee: $79.27
- Agent reasoning total: $89.32 (includes some items not fully verifiable)
- Agent final answer: $63.88

### Issues

1. **Synthesizer dropped items found by agent (major).** The agent's reasoning identified $89.32 across 12 items (including FIO French Roast Coffee $10.99 from Trader Joe's and additional La La Land receipts), but the synthesizer reported only $63.88 from 8 items. The synthesizer explicitly stated "No coffee items on Trader Joe's" -- directly contradicting the agent's own analysis which found "FIO French Roast Coffee $10.99."

2. **Missing items due to shape truncation.** While the shape step passed 14 receipts (an improvement from 8 in the baseline), some coffee items from the agent's reasoning were still lost. The FIO French Roast Coffee at Trader Joe's and at least 2-3 additional La La Land cafe receipts were identified in reasoning but not in the final answer.

3. **Coffee Mate creamer correctly excluded this time.** The baseline incorrectly included $15.98 of Coffee Mate creamer. The hybrid run correctly excludes creamers. This is an improvement.

4. **No double-counting of COFFEE MATE.** The baseline listed "2x COFFEE MATE CRMR at $7.99 each" when the receipt actually showed only 1. This error is gone.

5. **"This year" ambiguity.** The question refers to "this year" which depends on the run date. The agent appears to have used 2025 as the reference year.

**Tool Efficiency:** 6 calls (reasonable strategy -- text and semantic product line searches plus receipt searches and broader semantic searches)

**Improvements from Baseline:**

1. **Creamer correctly excluded.** Baseline wrongly included $15.98 of Coffee Mate creamer (with a doubled price error). Now correctly excluded.

2. **More receipts shaped.** Baseline shaped 8 receipts; hybrid shapes 14.

3. **Agent reasoning improved.** The agent reasoning step identified $89.32 including French Roast and additional cafe receipts -- more complete than the baseline's $80.12.

4. **No false-positive price errors.** The baseline doubled the Coffee Mate price from $7.99 to $15.98. No such errors here.

5. **Synthesizer still overrides agent (persistent issue).** Despite the improvements, the synthesizer still produces a lower total ($63.88) than the agent's reasoning ($89.32) by dropping items. The FIO French Roast Coffee ($10.99) was explicitly identified in reasoning but excluded in synthesis.

6. **Grade improved from D to C+.** The answer is closer to correct and avoids the false-positive creamer issue, but still suffers from items being dropped between reasoning and synthesis.
