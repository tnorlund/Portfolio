## Shape

8 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

You spent a total of **$63.97** on coffee this year across the following receipts (including coffee drinks, beans/grounds, and creamers; excluding non-coffee items like tips or food):

- **Vons** ($15.98): 2x COFFEE MATE CRMR at $7.99 each
- **Sprouts Farmers Market** ($15.99): ORG BIRCHWOOD COFFEE
- **Sunrose California Eatery** ($5.50): Drip Coffee
- **La La Land** ($10.00): Large Americano ($4.70) + Cappuccino ($5.30)
- **Le Pain Quotidien** ($11.25): Iced Latte ($6.25) + Iced Americano ($5.00)
- **Blue Bottle Coffee** ($5.25): Pour Over

No coffee items on Trader Joe's or Five07 Coffee Bar receipts. Insufficient item details on Trader Joe's.

## Evaluation

**Grade:** D

**Correct Answer:** Depends on scope, but the agent missed significant items either way.

### Independent Verification

My search found the following coffee-related line items with prices:

**Grocery coffee beans/grounds:**
| Item | Price | Merchant |
|------|-------|----------|
| ORG BIRCHWOOD COFFEE | $15.99 | Sprouts Farmers Market |
| FIO FRENCH ROAST COFFEE | $10.99 | Trader Joe's |
| KS ESPRESSO (beans) | $15.89 | Costco Wholesale |

**Cafe coffee drinks:**
| Item | Price | Merchant | Date |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| Drip Coffee | $5.50 | Sunrose California Eatery | 2/27/25 |
| Large Americano + Cappuccino | $10.00 | La La Land (Glendale) | 1/25/25 |
| Iced Latte + Iced Americano | $11.25 | Le Pain Quotidien | 3/15/25 |
| Pour Over | $5.25 | Blue Bottle Coffee | 11/9/25 |
| Vt Emperors Cloud (tea-based) | $4.25 | Starbucks | 11/16/25 |
| Large Americano | $4.80 | La La Land (Westlake) | 1/7/26 |
| Large House Coffee | $4.40 | La La Land Kind Cafe | 1/13/26 |
| Large House Coffee | $4.90 | La La Land (Westlake) | 1/28/26 |
| Large Americano | $4.80 | La La Land (Westlake) | 1/31/26 |

**Debatable:**
| Item | Price | Merchant | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| COFFEE MATE CRMR | $7.99 | Vons | Creamer, not coffee itself |

### Totals

- **Grocery beans/grounds only:** $42.87
- **Cafe drinks only (excl. Starbucks Emperor's Cloud, which is a tea):** $46.90
- **All coffee (beans + cafe drinks, excl. creamer and tea):** $89.77
- **Including Coffee Mate creamer:** $97.76
- **Including Starbucks Emperor's Cloud tea:** $94.02 / $101.76

### Issues

1. **Missed 5 coffee purchases (major):** The agent completely missed:
   - Starbucks Vt Emperors Cloud ($4.25) — though this is actually a tea-based drink, not coffee
   - La La Land Westlake 1/7/26 Large Americano ($4.80)
   - La La Land Kind Cafe 1/13/26 Large House Coffee ($4.40)
   - La La Land Westlake 1/28/26 Large House Coffee ($4.90)
   - La La Land Westlake 1/31/26 Large Americano ($4.80)
   These are 4 clear coffee items totaling $18.90 that were missed, plus 1 debatable tea item.

2. **Missed KS ESPRESSO and FIO FRENCH ROAST COFFEE (major):** The agent's Step 2 reasoning identified these items ($15.89 and $10.99) but the Final Answer dropped them entirely, claiming "No coffee items on Trader Joe's" — directly contradicting the agent's own earlier analysis.

3. **Coffee Mate creamer (debatable):** The agent included 2x COFFEE MATE CRMR at $7.99 each ($15.98 total). However, the Vons receipt shows only 1 COFFEE MATE CRMR at $7.99 (the $7.49 is actually LUC GREEK YOGURT). Even if we accept creamer as "coffee," the agent doubled the price. The actual COFFEE MATE price is $7.99, not $15.98.

4. **Incorrect COFFEE MATE quantity:** The agent listed "2x COFFEE MATE CRMR at $7.99 each" but the receipt clearly shows only 1 COFFEE MATE CRMR at $7.99. The $7.49 belongs to LUC GREEK YOGURT. This is a $7.99 overcount.

5. **Self-contradictory reasoning:** The agent's Step 2 found $80.12 across 11 items, but the Final Answer reported $63.97 across 6 line items. The agent's own intermediate work was more complete than the final answer.

6. **Five07 Coffee Bar correctly excluded:** The agent was right that the Five07 Coffee Bar receipt contains only Avocado Toast, no coffee items.

### Tool Efficiency

5 calls. The tool strategy was reasonable — text search for COFFEE, semantic search for coffee drinks, and follow-up searches. However, the agent failed to drill into all the La La Land receipts (there are 4 under "La La Land" merchant, not just the one it found). The agent also did not search for ESPRESSO, AMERICANO, LATTE, or CAPPUCCINO as text queries, which would have found additional items.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Search for related terms (ESPRESSO, LATTE, AMERICANO, CAPPUCCINO) as separate text queries to catch items that don't contain the word "coffee"
- Use `get_receipts_by_merchant` for coffee-related merchants (La La Land, Blue Bottle Coffee, Starbucks) to find all receipts, not just the ones that match text search
- After finding items in intermediate reasoning, do not drop them from the final answer without explanation
- Read individual receipts carefully to verify quantities and prices before reporting (the COFFEE MATE error suggests sloppy receipt parsing)
- Distinguish between coffee and non-coffee items at coffee shops (Emperor's Cloud is a tea)
