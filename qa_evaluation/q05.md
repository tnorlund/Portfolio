## Evaluation

**Grade:** A-

**Correct Answer:** 108 receipts from restaurant-related categories, totaling $3,850.19. Verified via `get_receipt_summaries` with `category_filter='restaurant'`, which returns exactly 108 receipts with total_spending $3,850.19, total_tax $804.19, and average_receipt $39.29.

**Tool Efficiency:** 5 calls (good -- used category filtering, list_categories, list_merchants, text search, and semantic search for comprehensive coverage)

**Issues:**
1. The Kansui Ramen total is reported as $0.00 in the evidence, but the database stores grand_total as $23.08. The $0.00 appears to be the "Amount Due" after a DoorDash credit. The synthesizer preserved this error from the shaped data.
2. Borderline categories (bar, bowling_alley, comedy_club, night_club, bagel_shop, ice_cream_shop, cafe, juice_shop) are included without explicit discussion of whether these count as "restaurants." This is a reasonable interpretation but the ambiguity could be noted.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
The baseline grade was B. The major improvement is that the hybrid shaping fix resolved the critical data loss problem: the baseline shaped only 5 receipts and the final answer listed only 5 examples with evidence, despite the agent finding 110. Now, all 108 receipts flow through to the synthesizer, and the final answer provides a comprehensive merchant-grouped listing with individual totals. The synthesizer's count (108), total ($3,850.19), and average ($39.29) all match the agent's reasoning and the ground truth perfectly. The only remaining issue is the Kansui Ramen $0.00 anomaly, which is a data quality problem rather than a pipeline failure. This is a significant improvement.
