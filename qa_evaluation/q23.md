### Evidence
34 evidence items with image_id, receipt_id, item, and amount for each breakfast item.

## Evaluation

**Grade:** B

**Correct Answer:** The agent found a comprehensive set of breakfast items. Independent verification confirms:
- EGG search: 35 matches (excluding false positives like EGGPLANT and REGGIANO), approximately 28 genuine egg purchases
- BACON search: 5 matches (4 FAMILY SIZE BACON + 1 CANADIAN BACON)
- BAGEL search: 11 matches, 3 with prices (Costco $7.99 x2, Vons $5.16)
- SAUSAGE search: 4 matches (ORG CHICKEN SAUSAGE $17.98 x2, SAUSAGE ITALIAN $6.99, SWT ONION SAUSAGE $6.49)
- YOGURT search: 12 matches
- CEREAL/OATMEAL: confirmed present

The agent's $367.86 total is plausible for the items listed in the evidence.

**Tool Efficiency:** 12 calls (good -- systematic search across breakfast categories: BREAKFAST, EGG, BACON, PANCAKE, WAFFLE, CEREAL, OATMEAL, MUFFIN, BAGEL, TOAST, plus semantic searches)

**Issues:**
1. Still misses sausage items entirely: ORG CHICKEN SAUSAGE ($17.98 x2), SAUSAGE ITALIAN ($6.99), SWT ONION SAUSAGE ($6.49) total $49.44 in missed breakfast protein. The agent searched for SAUSAGE-related items indirectly via semantic but did not do a direct text search for SAUSAGE.
2. Misses most yogurt purchases: 12 YOGURT line items exist (PLAIN WHL GRK YOGURT at $4.49-$5.99 across 8 Sprouts receipts, ORGANIC GREEK YOGURT $8.99 x2 at Sprouts, GREEK YOGURT $6.89 at Costco, LUC GREEK YOGURT at Vons). The agent only included the Vons yogurt from the shaped receipts but none of the 10 Sprouts/Costco yogurt items.
3. Several egg purchases are missing from the final answer: only 6 egg entries appear in the evidence, but the EGG search returns 35 matches (28+ genuine). The agent's reasoning noted "~30 relevant items" and "$240 total raw spend on eggs" but the shaped evidence only includes about $59 worth of eggs.
4. Raw whole milk ($10.99-$17.99) is included as a breakfast item in 4 places. This is borderline -- milk is general-purpose, not breakfast-specific. This inflates the total by ~$58.
5. Some Vons items from Receipt 12 are debatable: SOURDOUGH BOULE ($4.99 x2) and PHILLY CREAM ($6.99, $5.99) are reasonable breakfast associations but also used for general meals.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
- Major improvement in search strategy: 12 tool calls (vs 6 in baseline) with systematic coverage of BREAKFAST, EGG, BACON, PANCAKE, WAFFLE, CEREAL, OATMEAL, MUFFIN, BAGEL, TOAST. The baseline only searched BREAKFAST, EGG, BACON + semantic/receipt searches.
- The agent now finds bagels (Costco $7.99, Vons $5.16 x2, East Coast Bagel Co.), cereal (CINNAMON ROLL CEREAL $9.99, CHEERIOS $8.99, MALTO-MEAL $5.99 x2), oatmeal (SIG OATMEAL BROWN $5.49 x2), pancake mix (KRUSTEAZ BLUEBERRY $4.99, $4.49), and cream cheese (PHILLY CREAM $6.99, $5.99) -- all of which were missed in the baseline.
- Total items found increased from ~18 evidence items (baseline) to 34 evidence items.
- The shaped receipt count increased from 15 (baseline) to 20, preserving more data through the pipeline.
- Grade improved from C to B: substantially more comprehensive with fewer missed categories, though sausage and most yogurt/egg purchases are still missing from the final evidence.
