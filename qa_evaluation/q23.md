No exact matches for "BREAKFAST," pancakes, waffles, sausage, or muffins, but semantic searches identified related items like eggs, yogurt, bagels, and specific breakfast dishes. Here's a categorized summary of key purchases (deduplica...

## Evaluation

**Grade:** C

**Tool Efficiency:** 6 calls (reasonable count, but search strategy was too narrow)

**Issues:**
- **Massive undercounting of eggs**: Agent reported only 5 egg purchases across 5 receipts. Independent verification found 30+ egg line items across many receipts including ORG PSTR RSED EGGS ($13.99 x4), LARGE ALFRESCO EGGS ($9.99-$10.99 x3), CAGE FREE BROWN EGGS ($5.79 x2), SPROUTS LRG EGGS ($3.99 x3), ORG LRG GRADE A EGGS ($4.99-$11.99), EGG WHITES ($13.98), KS EGG WHITE ($14.99), LUCERNE EGGS (Vons), and Target eggs. The agent found fewer than 20% of egg purchases.
- **Missed entire categories of breakfast items**: Sausage (4 items: ORG CHICKEN SAUSAGE x2 at $17.98 each, SAUSAGE ITALIAN $6.99, SWT ONION SAUSAGE $6.49), cereal (CINNAMON ROLL CEREAL $9.99), oatmeal (SIG OATMEAL BROWN $5.49), rolled oats ($7.00), and KRUSTEAZ BLUEBERRY pancake/waffle mix ($4.49) were all completely absent.
- **Missed bagel purchases**: 11 bagel line items including grocery bagels from Costco ($7.99 x2) and Vons ($5.16), plus 5 East Coast Bagel Co. restaurant receipts (lox bagels ranging $12.60-$27.72) and 1 Noah's NY Bagels receipt ($16.28). Bagels are quintessential breakfast items.
- **Missed restaurant breakfast**: Stanley of New Orleans had a full breakfast order (Crab Cakes Benedict $23.75 + Creole Breakfast Potatoes $5.50). The semantic search found "Breakfast Classics" sections on Twisted Oak Tavern menus as well.
- **Missed most yogurt purchases**: Agent found 4 yogurt entries from Vons only. There are 12 yogurt line items across Sprouts (PLAIN WHL GRK YOGURT $4.49-$5.99 x8, ORGANIC GREEK YOGURT $8.99 x2) and Costco (GREEK YOGURT $6.89).
- **Missed cream cheese**: 2 SPROUTS CREAM CHEESE purchases at $4.98 each.
- **Debatable inclusions**: Coffee Mate creamer and challah bread are borderline -- not wrong to include, but not strongly breakfast-specific either. Milk (ORG A2/A2 6% MLK) is very general-purpose.
- **False positive concern**: Coffee Mate creamer is used in coffee generally, not breakfast-specific. Challah bread is typically used for various meals.
- **Total is significantly understated**: Agent reported $136.09 total. The actual breakfast item spending is substantially higher when accounting for all missed eggs, yogurt, bagels, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, and restaurant breakfast purchases.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Search for each breakfast category individually with text search: EGG, BACON, SAUSAGE, CEREAL, OATMEAL, OATS, BAGEL, YOGURT, PANCAKE, WAFFLE, MUFFIN, TOAST, CROISSANT, GRANOLA, CREAM CHEESE, CREAMER
- Check restaurant/cafe receipts from breakfast-oriented establishments (bagel shops, coffee bars, brunch restaurants)
- Use semantic search for "breakfast" to find restaurant items like "Crab Cakes Benedict" and "Breakfast Potatoes"
- After finding items, retrieve full receipts to verify context and avoid false positives
- The agent only used 6 tool calls -- more systematic searching would have caught the many missed categories
