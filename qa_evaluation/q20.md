(empty -- initial reasoning)

### Agent Step 10 (60000ms)

(empty -- second reasoning round)

### Agent Step 22 (16000ms)

You spent $92.24 on household cleaning supplies across 5 receipts from Target Grocery, Target Mobile, Laundry Valet (likely Target aisle/section), and BevMo!. Key items: Cascade dishwasher tabs ($24.99), Carpet cleaner ($18.99), Drano drain cleaner ($17.89), Clorox cleaner ($8.39), Mrs. Meyer's cleaner ($21.98). Total: $92.24.

## Shape

14 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

You spent a total of **$2,272.09** on household items (cleaning supplies, hardware/home improvement, and kitchen essentials like parchment paper). This includes full totals from primarily household-focused receipts and specific item amounts from mixed receipts.

Breakdown by receipt:
- The Home Depot: $2,142.49 (hardware, screws, clamps, bucket, plumbing fittings)
- Laundry Valet: $30.48 (carpet cleaner $18.99, laundry item $9.69)
- Laundry Valet: $19.59 (Drano drain cleaner $17.89)
- Target Grocery: $26.80 (Cascade dishwasher detergent)
- Target Mobile: $14.68 (Clorox cleaner $8.39, Dealworthy household item $4.99)
- Sprouts Farmers Market: $13.98 (parchment paper)
- BevMo!: $24.07 (Mrs. Meyer's cleaner $21.98)

## Evaluation

**Grade:** D

**Correct Answer:** The agent's intermediate reasoning of ~$92.24 for core cleaning supplies was closer to correct. Verifiable household cleaning items include: Cascade ($24.99), Carpet Cleaner ($18.99), Drano ($17.89), Clorox ($8.39), Mrs. Meyer's ($21.98), Lysol Wipes ($13.99), Dawn dish soap ($11.99). That totals ~$118. Adding borderline items like Febreze ($9.99), parchment paper ($13.98), and the Home Depot plumbing hardware (~$45.52 at actual receipt total of $68.43 pre-tax) could push it to ~$175-$245 depending on interpretation. The answer of $2,272.09 is wildly incorrect due to a misread of the Home Depot receipt.

**Tool Efficiency:** 19 calls (reasonable for this broad category -- thorough search strategy with text + semantic searches and individual receipt verification)

**Issues:**
1. The most critical error is attributing $2,142.49 to The Home Depot receipt as "household items." Independent verification of receipt `a893938d-146c-4381-a00a-88082627f353:1` shows the actual receipt GRAND_TOTAL is $68.43. The $2,142.49 figure appears on Line 44 as "2025 PRO XTRA SPEND 01/08: $2,142.49" -- this is a cumulative loyalty program spend figure, NOT the receipt total. The synthesize step misread this loyalty program line as the receipt's household spending.
2. This single misread inflates the total by $2,074.06, making the answer off by roughly 10-20x from any reasonable interpretation.
3. The agent's intermediate reasoning (Step 22) correctly identified $92.24 for 5 receipts, but the synthesize step contradicted this after the shape step exposed the Home Depot receipt with its misleading loyalty total.
4. "FARMS NF" ($9.69) from the Laundry Valet receipt is actually "VITAL FARMS NF" -- likely Vital Farms eggs, not a household item. This is a false positive.
5. Parchment paper ($13.98) is debatable as a "household item" -- it is more commonly categorized as a kitchen/cooking supply.
6. Still misses Dawn dish soap ($11.99, Vons) and Lysol Wipes ($13.99, Costco) which are clearly household cleaning items.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
- The hybrid shaping run uses more tool calls (19 vs 24 in baseline) but with a better search strategy -- adding PAPER TOWELS, TOILET PAPER, TRASH BAGS, KITCHEN SUPPLIES, BATHROOM SUPPLIES searches.
- The intermediate agent reasoning ($92.24) is more conservative and arguably more accurate than the baseline's $131.62 or $243.59.
- However, the final synthesized answer ($2,272.09) is dramatically worse than the baseline's $243.59 due to the Home Depot loyalty total misread. The shape step exposing raw receipt data caused the synthesize step to pick up a misleading number.
- The baseline correctly identified the Home Depot receipt total as $45.52 (item total) or $68.43 (with tax), while the hybrid shaping answer grabbed the $2,142.49 loyalty figure instead.
- Net regression: the hybrid shaping answer is significantly worse than the baseline (grade dropped from B to D).
