## Agent Reasoning

### Agent Step 2 (4000ms)

**You paid $2,191.42 in tax last quarter (July 1 to September 30, 2024).**

This total comes from 144 receipts (107 with totals), with overall spending of $20,725.17. Notable examples include:
- Chase Bank (2024-08-20): $1,566.29 tax
- Sprouts Farmers Market (various dates): Frequent smaller taxes like $31.26, $17.99, $44.55
- Other spots like restaurants (e.g., Sushi & Wasabi: $9.12) and services (e.g., Laundry Valet: $39.78)

Many grocery receipts (e.g., Costco, Sprouts) show $0 tax on food it...


## Shape

4 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**You paid a total of $0.96 in tax last quarter based on the available receipt data.**

- Costco Wholesale explicitly lists $0.00 tax.
- Sprouts Farmers Market (second receipt) lists $0.96 tax.
- The other receipts (Unknown and first Sprouts Farmers Market) do not specify tax amounts, so they are not included in the total.

## Evaluation

**Grade:** D

**Tool Efficiency:** 1 call (insufficient)

**Issues:**
- **Contradictory reasoning vs. final answer.** The agent's internal reasoning (Step 2) states "$2,191.42 in tax last quarter," yet the final answer says "$0.96." These numbers differ by over 2,000x. The shaping step apparently discarded 142 of 144 receipts and only retained 2 evidence rows, producing a wildly inaccurate total.
- **Ambiguous quarter selection with no exploration.** The agent chose Q3 2024 (Jul-Sep 2024) without any justification or exploration. "Last quarter" is relative to an unspecified current date. The agent should have first queried without date filters to understand the data range, then chosen the most recent quarter with data. Data exists across all quarters from Q2 2024 through Q4 2025+.
- **Only 1 tool call.** A single `get_receipt_summaries` call is technically sufficient if the correct quarter is chosen, but the agent needed at least one exploratory call first to determine the right date range.
- **Did not validate tax data quality.** The summary-level `total_tax` values from `get_receipt_summaries` contain many OCR misclassifications (e.g., Q4 2024 shows Sprouts at $60.18 tax on a $33.79 total, DIY Home Center at $42.97 tax on $15.32). The agent should have spot-checked suspicious values.
- **Final answer is not credible.** Reporting $0.96 total tax for an entire quarter (with 144 receipts and $20k+ spending) should have triggered the agent to re-examine its data.

**Ground Truth (from `get_receipt_summaries`):**
| Quarter | Receipts | Total Spending | Total Tax (summary) |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Q2 2024 | 228 | $62,504.94 | $1,358.68 |
| Q3 2024 | 212 | $21,009.40 | $2,191.42 |
| Q4 2024 | 192 | $4,005.07 | $551.80 |
| Q1 2025 | 252 | $14,615.02 | $1,382.15 |

Note: The summary-level tax totals include OCR misclassifications where product prices were labeled as TAX. True tax amounts are likely lower. The agent neither selected the right quarter nor reported the correct aggregate for any quarter.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Start with an unfiltered `get_receipt_summaries` call to understand the date range of available data before choosing a quarter.
- Use the aggregate `total_tax` from the summaries response rather than manually summing from only shaped receipts.
- Sanity-check the final answer: $0.96 tax on $20k+ spending is implausible and should trigger re-examination.
- If the question is ambiguous (no "current date" anchor), the agent should state its assumption about which quarter it is reporting on.
- Spot-check receipts where tax exceeds grand_total or subtotal, as these indicate labeling errors.
