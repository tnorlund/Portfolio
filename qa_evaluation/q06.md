## Agent Reasoning

**You paid $2,191.42 in tax last quarter (July 1 to September 30, 2024).**

This total comes from 212 receipts with available tax data (113 had explicit totals). Key contributors include:
- Chase Bank (image_id: 83e273c8-1703-43f4-ad5a-7a8c8ea2ed97, receipt_id: 2): $1,566.29 tax
- Sprouts Farmers Market (multiple, e.g., image_id: 3b594aaf-915e-49cc-97e6-3a924710cabf, receipt_id: 1): Various amounts like $44.55
- Other notable: BevMo! ($68.03), restaurants like Tabu Shabu ($13.65), and various grocery/dining spots.

Many receipts (e.g., Costco) show $0 tax due to tax-exempt items or no-tax states on certain purchases.

## Shape

200 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**$2,157.56**

This is the total tax listed across all receipts in the provided data for last quarter (July-September 2024, matching the pre-computed summary period with 212 receipts totaling $21,009.40 spent). However, **tax information is insufficient and incomplete**:
- Tax is explicitly listed on only ~50 receipts (others have no tax field or "Items: 0").
- Several listed taxes exceed the receipt total (e.g., Sprouts #46: $44.55 tax on $14.25 total) or imply unrealistic rates (>10%, vs. typical LA sales tax ~9.5%), suggesting possible OCR/parsing errors, non-sales-tax fees (e.g., property tax escrow in Chase Bank), or subtotals mislabeled as "tax".
- Excluding 7 anomalous cases where tax > total reduces the sum to **$1,901.48**, but even this may include non-sales taxes.

Key contributors:
- Chase Bank (#48): $1,566.29
- Sprouts Farmers Market (#7): $31.26
- Costco Wholesale (#87): $30.28

### Evidence
Evidence entries provided for multiple receipts showing tax amounts ranging from $0.00 to $1,566.29.

## Evaluation

**Grade:** B-

**Correct Answer:** The pre-computed aggregate from `get_receipt_summaries` for Q3 2024 (July-September) returns `total_tax: $2,191.42` across 212 receipts with total_spending of $21,009.40. However, "last quarter" is ambiguous without an anchor date. The agent chose Q3 2024, which is a reasonable interpretation given the data range.

**Tool Efficiency:** 1 call (efficient -- the single `get_receipt_summaries` call with date filters was the right approach)

**Issues:**
1. The synthesizer reports $2,157.56 rather than the pre-computed aggregate of $2,191.42 from the agent's reasoning. This ~$34 discrepancy suggests the synthesizer re-summed from the shaped receipt data rather than trusting the pre-computed aggregate. The pre-computed aggregate is more reliable since it covers all 212 receipts.
2. The quarter selection (Q3 2024) is still unjustified. The agent did not explore what date range the data covers before choosing a quarter. Without an anchor "current date," the most recent quarter with data would be the better default.
3. The Chase Bank "tax" of $1,566.29 dominates the total and is almost certainly not sales tax -- it is likely a property tax escrow payment or similar. The synthesizer correctly flags this as anomalous but still includes it in the headline number.
4. The data quality caveats in the final answer are excellent -- noting OCR errors, anomalous tax > total cases, and non-sales-tax items. This shows good analytical judgment.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
The baseline grade was D. The critical improvement is that the synthesizer no longer produces a wildly incorrect answer. In the baseline, the shape step passed only 4 receipts to the synthesizer, which then reported $0.96 total tax -- off by 2,000x from the agent's correct $2,191.42. Now, 200 receipts are shaped and passed through, and the synthesizer produces $2,157.56, which is within 1.5% of the pre-computed aggregate. The synthesizer also provides thoughtful data quality analysis, identifying anomalous cases and providing an alternate sum of $1,901.48 excluding outliers. While the ~$34 gap between synthesizer and aggregate remains, and the quarter selection is still unjustified, the answer has gone from catastrophically wrong to substantially correct with appropriate caveats. This is a major improvement.
