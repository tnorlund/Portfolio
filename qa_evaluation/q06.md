## Final Answer

**You paid a total of $0.96 in tax last quarter based on the available receipt data.**

- Costco Wholesale explicitly lists $0.00 tax.
- Sprouts Farmers Market (second receipt) lists $0.96 tax.
- The other receipts (Unknown and first Sprouts Farmers Market) do not specify tax amounts, so they are not included in the total.
