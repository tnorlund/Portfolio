**Your cheapest grocery trip was $0.99 at Vons on 2024-06-03 (image_id: fa23150b-944e-4f65-87ca-da795f18a0f9, receipt_id: 1).**

This was a small purchase with 8 items (subtotal: $0.99, tax: $1.98). Other low trips include:
- $1.49 at Vons (multiple, e.g., 2024-07-29, image_id: 6d7db41f)
- $1.73 at Sprouts Farmers Market (2025-10-08, image_id: d1435626)
- $3.15 at Sprouts Farmers Market (2025-11-08, image_id: f30c3d0f)

From 224+ grocery_store receipts (avg. $29.78) and 227 grocery receipts (avg. $29.62).

## Shape

## Final Answer

**Your cheapest grocery trip was $0.99 at Vons (Receipt 148, ID: fa23150b-944e-4f65-87ca-da795f18a0f9:1, Date: 2024-06-03).**

This is the lowest explicit total among all receipts. Other low totals include $1.49 at Vons (Receipts 83 and 153) and $1.93 at Vons (Receipts 155 and 161), but none are lower.

**Evidence:**
```json
[
  {
    "image_id": "fa23150b-944e-4f65-87ca-da795f18a0f9:1",
    "receipt_id": "148",
    "item": "Total",
    "amount": "$0.99"
  }
]
```

## Evaluation

**Grade:** A

**Correct Answer:** The cheapest grocery trip was **$0.99 at Vons** on 2024-06-03 (image_id: fa23150b-944e-4f65-87ca-da795f18a0f9, receipt_id: 1). MCP verification confirms the receipt contains a single item: GREEN ONIONS at $0.99, with $0.00 tax and a $0.99 balance. The "TOTAL NUMBER OF ITEMS SOLD = 1" line confirms this was a one-item purchase (the agent incorrectly said 8 items, but the receipt summary system may have counted differently).

**Tool Efficiency:** 4 calls (excellent). The agent called `list_categories`, `list_merchants`, and `get_receipt_summaries` for two grocery categories. This is the optimal approach -- query all grocery summaries and sort by total.

**Issues:**
1. Minor: The agent reasoning mentioned "8 items" for the $0.99 receipt but the actual receipt shows only 1 item sold. The summary system reported item_count=8, which may be an OCR/parsing artifact.
2. The next-cheapest trips mentioned differ slightly between agent reasoning ($1.49, $1.73) and the final answer ($1.49, $1.93), but both correctly identify $0.99 as the cheapest.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
- **Major improvement.** The baseline graded F because the synthesizer overrode the agent's correct $0.99 answer and substituted $6.48 at Sprouts Farmers Market. The hybrid shaping fix has resolved this completely.
- The final answer now correctly reports $0.99 at Vons with proper evidence, matching the agent's reasoning.
- The shape step processed 200 receipts (vs. 10 in baseline), ensuring the synthesizer had access to the full dataset.
- The synthesizer now builds on the agent's reasoning rather than contradicting it.
- Grade improved from F to A.
