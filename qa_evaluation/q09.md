## Agent Reasoning

### Agent Step 3 (23000ms)

**You spent $211.52 on organic products across 25 line items from receipts primarily at Sprouts Farmers Market (produce like green onions, carrots, milk, yogurt, sour cream) and Costco Wholesale (e.g., organic ground coffee at $24.99 per item, organic dates).**

This total comes from aggregating LINE_TOTAL amounts filtered for "ORG" (capturing abbreviations like ORG milk, ORG ginger) and cross-checked with "ORGANIC" text matches ($131.83 from 15 items, overlapping). Key examples:
- Costco: ORGAN...


## Shape

15 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**You spent a total of $322.74 on organic products across all receipts.**

## Evaluation

**Grade:** D

**Tool Efficiency:** 10 calls (excessive and poorly targeted; 2-3 well-structured calls would have been sufficient)

**Accuracy Assessment:**
- The agent claimed $322.74 across 28 line items from 15 receipts.
- Independent verification using `search_product_lines` with text search for "ORGANIC" returns 62 matches (raw total $261.35), and "ORG " returns 141 matches (100 shown, raw total $1,058.03 for those 100 alone).
- The agent captured only a small fraction of all organic products. Major categories missed include:
  - ORG WHOLE MILK at $10.99 (appears on ~15 receipts)
  - ORG A2/A2 6% FAT MLK at $7.99 (appears on ~14 receipts)
  - ORG PSTR RSED EGGS at $13.99 (appears ~4 times)
  - ORG CAGE FREE EGGS at $6.99 (appears ~2 times)
  - ORG SOURDOUGH BREAD at $5.99 (appears ~6 times)
  - ORG EV OLIVE OIL at $32.99
  - ORG CHICKEN SAUSAGE at $17.98 (appears ~2 times)
  - ORG BIRCHWOOD COFFEE at $15.99
  - ORG VANILLA EXTRACT at $19.99
  - ORG RFND COCONUT OIL at $7.29 (appears ~3 times)
  - ORG LEMONS 2 LB BAG at $4.99 (appears ~3 times)
  - ORG BS THIGH at $22.76 (additional Costco receipt missed)
  - ORG CHKTENDR at $28.87 (duplicate receipt missed)
  - ORGANIC CARROT JUICE at $10.49 and $9.99
  - ORGANIC POPCORN at $6.49
  - ORGANIC CUCUMBERS at $6.25
  - ORGANIC STRAWBERRIES at $6.99
  - Many more ORG-prefixed items across dozens of receipts
- The true total of organic spending is far higher than $322.74 -- likely in the range of $800-$1,200+ when all unique receipt line items are properly deduplicated and summed.
- The arithmetic for the 28 items the agent did list is correct ($322.74 checks out).

**Issues:**
- **Severe undercounting**: The agent found only ~28 of potentially 100+ unique organic line items, missing the majority of organic purchases.
- **Tool call failures**: Two calls used `aggregate_amounts` and `semantic_search`, which appear to be non-existent tools (returned 0ms, suggesting immediate failure). These wasted tool calls.
- **Search limit hit without follow-up**: The "ORG" text search likely returned 100 items (the limit), but the agent did not paginate or increase the limit to capture all results.
- **No deduplication strategy**: The agent did not account for the same receipt appearing under different image_ids (multiple scans of the same receipt). However, even with deduplication, the true total far exceeds $322.74.
- **False positive risk**: "DAWN ULTRA LIQ ORG" from Vons likely means "Original" not "Organic" -- this type of false positive was not addressed.
- **Inconsistent reasoning**: The agent's step 3 reasoning mentions $211.52 across 25 items, but the final answer jumps to $322.74 across 28 items without clear explanation of the discrepancy.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Use `search_product_lines` with "ORG" text search at a higher limit (e.g., 500) to capture all organic items in a single call.
- Supplement with "ORGANIC" text search to catch any items not abbreviated.
- Deduplicate by unique (image_id, receipt_id) pairs to avoid counting the same receipt scan twice.
- Filter out false positives where "ORG" does not mean organic (e.g., "DAWN ULTRA LIQ ORG" = Dawn Original).
- Avoid calling non-existent tools (`aggregate_amounts`, `semantic_search`).
- 3-4 well-targeted calls would suffice: one "ORG" search, one "ORGANIC" search (both at high limits), then selective `get_receipt` calls for ambiguous items.
