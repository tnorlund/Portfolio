## Agent Reasoning

**You spent $295.26 on organic products** across 27 line items from receipts at Sprouts Farmers Market, Costco Wholesale, and Wrightwood Fine Foods.

Key items include:
- Organic chicken (thighs and tenders): ~$126 (e.g., $38.28 ORG BS THIGH at Costco, $28.87 ORG CHKTENDR x2)
- ORG EV OLIVE OIL: $32.99 (Sprouts)
- ORGANIC GRND (ground beef/coffee?): $24.99 (Costco)
- ORGANIC CARROT JUICE: $10.49 (Sprouts)
- Various ORG/ORGANIC produce & dairy (green onions, sour cream, greek yogurt, blueberries, etc.): ~$50

## Shape

17 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**You spent a total of $320.25 on organic products across all receipts.**

Breakdown by receipt (17 receipts total):
- Wrightwood Fine Foods: $6.99 (ORGANIC STRAWBERRIES)

- Sprouts Farmers Market (Receipt 4): $16.98 (ORG A2/A2 6% FAT MLK + ORGANIC GREEK YOGURT)

## Evaluation

**Grade:** C-

**Correct Answer:** The true total of organic spending is significantly higher than $320.25. Independent verification using `search_product_lines` with "ORGANIC" text search returns 62 matches with raw_total of $261.35, and "ORG" text search returns 216 total matches (100 shown) with raw_total of $1,178.69 for those 100 alone. After deduplication (many items appear in both searches, and some receipt images are duplicates), a conservative estimate of organic spending is in the $600-$900 range. Major categories missed by the agent include:

- **ORG WHOLE MILK at $10.99** (appears on ~14 receipts = ~$153.86) -- the single largest organic spending category
- **ORG A2/A2 6% FAT MLK at $7.99** (appears on ~14 receipts = ~$111.86) -- only 1 captured
- **ORG PSTR RSED EGGS at $13.99** (appears ~4 times = ~$55.96)
- **ORG SOURDOUGH BATARD at $7.99** and other bread items
- **ORG CAGE FREE EGGS at $6.99** (appears ~2 times)
- **ORG BIRCHWOOD COFFEE at $15.99**
- **ORG VANILLA EXTRACT at $19.99**
- **ORG RFND COCONUT OIL at $7.29** (appears ~3 times)
- **ORG BROCCOLI FLORETS at $8.49** (appears ~3 times)
- **ORG RED SDLS GRAPES at $8.22**
- **ORG FR EGGS at $7.99** from Costco (~3 times)
- **KOMBUCHA-ORG-ENLIGHT at $8.99** (appears ~3 times)
- **ORGANIC BANANAS** (multiple receipts, various amounts)
- Many more ORG-prefixed items across dozens of receipts

**Tool Efficiency:** 9 calls (mixed quality -- the 3 `aggregate_amounts` calls appear to be non-existent tools that returned nothing, wasting 3 of 9 calls. The "ORG" search with limit 50 hit the cap and missed most results.)

**Issues:**
1. **Severe undercounting.** The agent found ~27-28 organic items totaling $295-$320, but the actual count is 200+ line items (with deduplication likely reducing to 100+ unique purchases). The total is roughly 2-3x what was reported.
2. **Search limit too low.** The "ORG" text search used limit 50, but there are 216 total matches. This single decision caused the agent to miss the majority of organic products, particularly the frequently-purchased ORG WHOLE MILK ($10.99 x 14 receipts) which is the largest single organic spending category.
3. **Non-existent tool calls.** Three `aggregate_amounts` calls wasted tool invocations, as this tool does not appear in the MCP tool list. The 0ms duration confirms they returned nothing.
4. **False positive risk not addressed.** "DAWN ULTRA LIQ ORG" from Vons ($11.99) means "Original" not "Organic," and KOMBUCHA-ORG-ENLIGHT contains "ORG" but the full word is a brand abbreviation. These cases were neither included nor explicitly excluded.
5. **The synthesizer total ($320.25) differs from the agent total ($295.26)** without explanation. The synthesizer found additional items from the shaped receipt data that the agent missed, suggesting the shaping step added value.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
The baseline grade was D. The baseline reported $322.74 across 28 items, and the hybrid version reports $320.25 across 28 items from 17 receipts -- nearly identical coverage. The improvements are marginal: the synthesizer now provides a cleaner, receipt-by-receipt breakdown with explicit item names and amounts, and the evidence array is well-structured. However, the fundamental problem of undercounting persists because the agent's search strategy (limit 50 for "ORG") did not capture enough results. The grade improves slightly from D to C- because the answer presentation is more organized and the items found are correctly identified and summed, but the total still represents less than half of actual organic spending. The core issue is tool usage strategy, not the shaping pipeline.
