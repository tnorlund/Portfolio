## Evaluation

**Grade:** A

**Correct Answer:** $1,960.20 across 28 receipts (average $70.01, tax $179.77). Verified via `get_receipt_summaries` with `merchant_filter='Costco'`, which returns exactly these figures.

**Tool Efficiency:** 1 call (optimal -- single `get_receipt_summaries` with `merchant_filter='Costco'` is the best possible approach)

**Issues:**

1. **Duplicate receipts in data (minor, not agent's fault).** Two Costco receipts from 2023-04-23 (image_ids `165b9d15` and `6cd1f7f5`) both show $198.93 with 25 and 18 items respectively. These appear to be two scans of the same physical receipt. The agent correctly reports the tool's output but does not flag the potential duplicate.

2. **No date range caveat.** The question asks for "total spending at Costco" with no time bound, and the agent correctly provides the all-time total. No issue here.

**Improvements from Baseline:**

1. **Shape data loss completely fixed (critical improvement).** The baseline was graded F because the shape step truncated 28 receipts to only 5, producing a final answer of $293.52 (85% below the correct value). The hybrid shaping now passes all 28 receipts through to the synthesizer.

2. **Reasoning and synthesis now agree.** In the baseline, the agent correctly reasoned $1,960.20 but the synthesizer overrode it with $293.52. Now the synthesizer correctly reports $1,960.20.

3. **Complete evidence provided.** The evidence array lists all 28 receipts with their individual totals, enabling full verification. The baseline only showed 5.

4. **Grade improved from F to A.** This is the most dramatic improvement across all five questions, demonstrating that the hybrid shaping fix directly resolved the core data loss bug that made the baseline answer catastrophically wrong.
