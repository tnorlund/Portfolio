## Evaluation

**Grade:** F

**Tool Efficiency:** 2 calls (reasonable -- first call got all receipts, second filtered to November 2025)

**Issues:**
- **Final answer contradicts the agent's own reasoning.** Step 3 correctly identified $413.00 at HOMG West Hills as the largest purchase in November 2025, but the Final Answer reports $33.00 at Lexen Hotel -- a completely different and much smaller receipt.
- **Lexen Hotel receipt is from January 2024, not November 2025.** The receipt text shows date "1/16/24 4:30:22 PM" (image_id `9983a3fc-ad3c-421b-9968-1d4e9c687409`, receipt_id 2). It should not appear as a November 2025 purchase. This receipt likely appeared in the November filter because many receipts lack parsed dates and the system included undated receipts.
- **$33.00 is nowhere near the largest.** Even among receipts with explicit November 2025 dates, several are larger: $59.00 (Fey Chiropractic, 11/12), $50.65 (Costco, 11/8), $35.12 (Academy LA, 11/15).
- **The correct answer from the agent's own data is $413.00 at HOMG West Hills** (though OCR quality on that receipt is poor and the total may be an artifact). If excluding questionable OCR, the next candidates are $160.00 (Dr. Lisa Woolf), $153.65 (Tabu Shabu -- but dated May 2025), $130.23 (Sprouts -- but actually an OCR error on a $10.99 receipt), and $103.40 (Tan L.A.).
- **Data quality challenges are real** -- many receipts lack dates and some grand_totals are OCR errors -- but the agent did not acknowledge or navigate these issues. It simply picked an incorrect, small-value receipt.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- The agent must ensure the Final Answer is consistent with its own intermediate reasoning. The Step 3 analysis was reasonable; the Final Answer inexplicably diverged.
- Sort results by grand_total descending and present the top result. The agent appears to have selected the wrong receipt during the "shaping" step.
- Validate receipt dates against the target month. The Lexen Hotel receipt's date field ("1/16/24") clearly places it outside November 2025.
- Flag receipts with suspicious OCR (e.g., garbled text around totals) and present them with appropriate caveats rather than silently including or excluding them.
- When many receipts lack dates, the agent should note this ambiguity rather than presenting a confident but wrong answer.
