## Agent Reasoning

**Your largest purchase this month (November 2025) was $413.00 at HOMG West Hills (image_id: 33ca0e5b-3b1b-465c-adf8-1b2b82b47282, receipt_id: 1, category: health).**

This stands out as the highest grand total among 179 receipts totaling $3,225.26 in spending (78 with totals, average $41.35). Other notable high ones included:
- $160.00 at Dr. Lisa Woolf, MD (doctor's office)
- $153.65 at Tabu Shabu - Thousand Oaks (Japanese restaurant)
- $102.51 at Sushi & Wasabi (sushi restaurant)
- $103.40 at Tan L.A. (tanning studio)

## Shape

200 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**Your largest purchase this month (November 2025) was $50.65 at Costco Wholesale on 2025-11-08.**

This edges out the next highest: $35.12 at Academy LA (2025-11-15) and $32.74 at Sprouts Farmers Market (2025-11-03). Note: Many receipts lack dates or totals, so additional large purchases cannot be ruled out if they fall in this period.

## Evaluation

**Grade:** D

**Correct Answer:** The largest purchase in November 2025 is $413.00 at HOMG West Hills (health service). Verified via `get_receipt_summaries` with November 2025 date filter: 179 receipts, total_spending $3,225.26. The HOMG West Hills receipt (image_id: 33ca0e5b, receipt_id: 1) has grand_total of $413.00 with no explicit date (null), but it falls within the November 2025 filter range. Other large undated receipts in this range include Dr. Lisa Woolf at $160.00, Tabu Shabu at $153.65, Sprouts at $130.23, Sushi & Wasabi at $102.51, and Tan L.A. at $103.40.

**Tool Efficiency:** 2 calls (reasonable -- first call explored the data range, second filtered to November 2025)

**Issues:**
1. **The final answer contradicts the agent's own reasoning.** The agent correctly identified $413.00 at HOMG West Hills as the largest purchase, but the synthesizer reported $50.65 at Costco Wholesale instead. The Costco receipt is the largest receipt with an explicit November 2025 date, but many larger receipts have null dates and still appear in the November filter results.
2. **The synthesizer appears to have filtered to only explicitly-dated receipts.** The $413.00 HOMG West Hills receipt has `date: null` but is included in the November 2025 date-filtered results. The synthesizer apparently only considered receipts with explicit dates (Costco 11/08, Academy LA 11/15, Sprouts 11/03), missing all undated receipts.
3. **Even among dated receipts, the answer may be wrong.** The Fey Chiropractic receipt dated 2025-11-12 has grand_total $59.00, which is higher than the reported $50.65 Costco receipt.
4. **The caveats in the final answer are appropriate** ("Many receipts lack dates or totals"), but the agent should have included undated receipts rather than just noting their exclusion.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
The baseline grade was F. The baseline had the exact same core problem -- the agent's reasoning correctly identified $413.00 at HOMG West Hills, but the synthesizer reported a much smaller amount ($33.00 at Lexen Hotel in the baseline, $50.65 at Costco now). The hybrid shaping fix passed 200 receipts instead of 8, and the synthesizer now at least picks a real November 2025 receipt (Costco 11/08) rather than a January 2024 receipt (Lexen Hotel). However, the fundamental issue persists: the synthesizer ignores the agent's correct analysis and re-derives a wrong answer from the shaped data by filtering to only explicitly-dated receipts. The improvement from F to D reflects that the answer is at least within the correct month and from a plausible receipt, but it still misses the actual largest purchase by a factor of 8x. The root cause appears to be a synthesizer-level bug where it does not trust the agent's pre-computed aggregates.
