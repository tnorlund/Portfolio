## Agent Reasoning

The agent identified **77 unique receipts** with milk purchases, almost all from Sprouts Farmers Market. Key product types:
- RAW WHOLE MILK ($17.99, $10.99, $18.99) -- most common, ~20 receipts
- ORG WHOLE MILK ($10.99)
- RAW MILK ($6.99)
- ORG A2/A2 6% FAT MLK ($7.99)
- F RAW WHOLE MILK

Provided 5 example receipts with image IDs and prices. Noted that "MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS" was excluded as a false positive.

## Shape

20 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

Listed 18 receipts from Sprouts Farmers Market with milk purchases:

1. Receipt 1 (60a66445): RAW WHOLE MILK $17.99
2. Receipt 2 (9afeb902): RAW WHOLE MILK $17.99
3. Receipt 3 (b4b269e9): WHOLE MILK $17.99
4. Receipt 4 (34eecba2:2): ORG WHOLE MILK $10.99
5. Receipt 6 (99a224b4:2): RAW WHOLE MILK $17.99
6. Receipt 7 (63aa7edd): RAW WHOLE MILK $10.99
7. Receipt 9 (cdf8dbe6): RAW WHOLE MILK F $10.99
8. Receipt 10 (0fca7cfd:2): ORG WHOLE MILK $10.99
9. Receipt 11 (6a23eb4b:2): ORG FF GRASSED MILK $8.49
10. Receipt 12 (1b441d33): ORG A2/A2 6% FAT MLK F $7.99 + WHOLE MILK F $4.49
11. Receipt 13 (9a3a28ce): ORG WHOLE MILK $10.99
12. Receipt 14 (34eecba2:1): RAW WHOLE MILK $18.99
13. Receipt 15 (08239059): RAW WHOLE MILK $10.99
14. Receipt 16 (887079fa): ORG WHOLE MILK $10.99
15. Receipt 17 (e62eadbe): WHOLE MILK $10.99
16. Receipt 18 (d1435626:2): ORG WHOLE MILK $10.99
17. Receipt 19 (39cbb34f): RAW WHOLE MILK $17.99
18. Receipt 20 (28b004eb): ORG WHOLE MILK $10.99

Correctly excluded "MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS" from Receipt 5 as not being dairy milk.

## Evaluation

**Grade:** B+

**Correct Answer:** MCP tool verification via `search_product_lines` for "MILK" (text search) returns 78 total matches. After excluding false positives (MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS -- 3 items, ORG COCONUT MILK -- 1 item), there are approximately 74 genuine dairy milk line items across 60+ unique receipts, overwhelmingly from Sprouts Farmers Market with 2 from Vons (V CRNR WHOLE MILK at $3.99 each).

Product types confirmed:
- RAW WHOLE MILK at $17.99 (20+ receipts), $18.99 (4 receipts), $10.99 (15+ receipts)
- ORG WHOLE MILK at $10.99 (15+ receipts), $9.99 (1 receipt), $6.99 (1 receipt)
- RAW MILK at $6.99 (2 receipts)
- VIT D WHOLE MILK at $5.49 (1 receipt)
- ORG FF GRASSED MILK at $8.49 (1 receipt)
- WHOLE MILK at $4.49 (1 receipt)
- V CRNR WHOLE MILK at $3.99 (2 Vons receipts)

**Tool Efficiency:** 5 calls (adequate -- 2 receipt searches + 2 product line searches + 1 semantic search)

**Issues:**
1. The final answer lists 18 receipts but the agent reasoning identified 77. The shape step (20 receipts shaped) limited what the synthesizer could see, causing a ~75% data loss. However, 18 receipts is a reasonable representative sample.
2. All listed receipts are verified as correct -- every image_id and price matches the MCP data.
3. Vons milk purchases (V CRNR WHOLE MILK at $3.99, 2 receipts: 678a7c94 and 2360d36e) are still missing. The answer claims "all from Sprouts Farmers Market."
4. The `search_product_lines` limit of 50 captures most matches (78 total exist), but `search_receipts` limit of 20 may have truncated some results.
5. Correctly excluded MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS as a false positive -- good filtering judgment.
6. The ORG COCONUT MILK ($3.98) is a borderline item that was apparently not in the shaped set, which is fine since the question likely means dairy milk.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
- More receipts in final answer: 18 (vs baseline's 11). The additional 7 receipts include ORG FF GRASSED MILK, ORG A2/A2 6% FAT MLK, and several more RAW WHOLE MILK and ORG WHOLE MILK entries.
- Better product variety: the final answer now includes ORG FF GRASSED MILK ($8.49) and ORG A2/A2 6% FAT MLK ($7.99) which were missing from baseline.
- Evidence array improved: 19 evidence items (vs baseline's 12), including the two items from Receipt 12 (A2/A2 milk + WHOLE MILK).
- Shape step processed 20 receipts (vs baseline's 13), allowing more data through to synthesis.
- Agent reasoning count is similar: 77 vs 76 unique receipts.
- Both versions miss the 2 Vons milk receipts.
- Grade improved from B to B+: more complete enumeration, better evidence, same core accuracy.
