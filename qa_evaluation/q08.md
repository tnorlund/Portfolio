## Agent Reasoning

The agent identified receipts with individual items over $50 by combining text search, semantic search, product line search, and individual receipt inspection. Key findings:

- **Harbor Freight**: 20V 6-TOOL COMBO KIT at $199.99 (total $218.99)
- **The Home Depot (6213)**: SS LINEAR DRAIN at $139.00, CARLON NEW WORK at $302.28, SPL 6X10 shower pan liner at $79.98
- **The Home Depot (a1c5)**: Multiple items including SUPER BLUE22 at $400.95, RANGE BOX at $302.28, ABS TEE at $294.42 (likely multi-unit bulk purchases)
- **Sparkling Image Car Wash**: Unlimited Full Service at $64.99
- **Costco**: Borderline at $50.97 subtotal
- **Target**: SMART & FINAL GIFT CARD at exactly $50.00

## Shape

50 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**Receipts with individual items over $50:**

- **Sprouts Farmers Market** (Receipt 18): gift card - **$250.00**
- **Lowe's Home Improvement** (Receipt 9): CT 5/8 X X MMA GB - **$103.92**
- **Kruse + Company Bicycles** (Receipt 22): Battery Recovery - **$100.00**
- **Sparkling Image Car Wash** (Receipt 25): Unlimited Full Service Sparkle - **$64.99**
- **Target** (Receipt 30): up Up&Up & up T - **$99.00**
- **Nordstrom** (Receipt 40): GA - **$300.00**
- **Harbor Freight** (Receipt 48): 20V 6-TOOL COMBO KIT - **$199.99**
- **The Home Depot** (Receipt 49): SS LINEAR DRAIN TILE-IN GRATE - **$139.00**

Notes: Multiple Home Depot receipts contain lines with implausibly high amounts (e.g., $1000+), likely OCR/scanning errors. Items exactly $50 or with dubious OCR excluded.

### Evidence
8 evidence entries provided with image_ids and amounts ranging from $64.99 to $300.00.

## Evaluation

**Grade:** B-

**Correct Answer:** This is a difficult question because the receipt data has no reliable way to search by price threshold. The ground truth requires inspecting all receipts with LINE_TOTAL labels > $50 and filtering out non-item lines (subtotals, taxes, tips, payments, loyalty promotions). A comprehensive answer would include items from Harbor Freight ($199.99 combo kit), Home Depot (multiple items: $139.00 drain, $79.98 shower pan, etc.), Floor & Decor ($269.80 tile, $130.56 tile), Nordstrom ($148.00 and $98.00 clothing items), Lowe's ($103.92), Kruse Bicycles ($100.00), Sparkling Image ($64.99), and multiple 7-Eleven gas prepays at $100.00 each.

**Tool Efficiency:** 16 calls (high -- the agent used 6 search calls plus 10 individual receipt lookups, which is excessive but reflects the difficulty of the question)

**Issues:**
1. The synthesizer found several items the agent missed, including a Sprouts gift card at $250.00, a Nordstrom item at $300.00, and a Target item at $99.00. This suggests the 50 shaped receipts contained useful data that the agent's 10 receipt lookups did not cover.
2. The Home Depot multi-unit bulk purchases (SUPER BLUE22 at $400.95, RANGE BOX at $302.28) from the agent reasoning were correctly excluded by the synthesizer as likely OCR errors, though they are actually valid LINE_TOTAL values for multi-unit orders.
3. The 7-Eleven gas prepays at $100.00 each were found by the agent but not included in the final answer, possibly filtered as not being "items" in the traditional sense.
4. Floor & Decor tiles ($269.80 and $130.56) were still missed by both agent and synthesizer.
5. The Nordstrom "$300.00" item labeled "GA" is suspicious -- it could be a gift card or an OCR artifact. The actual Nordstrom receipt likely has clothing items at $148.00 and $98.00 based on the baseline evaluation.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
The baseline grade was C. The improvements are notable: the synthesizer now has access to 50 shaped receipts (vs. 47 in baseline), and the final answer includes items the agent's reasoning missed, such as the Sprouts $250.00 gift card, Nordstrom $300.00, and Target $99.00. The baseline final answer listed 16 line items across 10 receipts but included false positives (Pro Xtra $100 loyalty text). The hybrid version's answer is more curated (8 items) with fewer false positives, though it may have over-filtered. The synthesizer shows better judgment in excluding OCR artifacts while catching items the agent overlooked. The improvement from C to B- reflects better synthesis quality and fewer false positives, though completeness remains imperfect given the inherent difficulty of searching by price threshold.
