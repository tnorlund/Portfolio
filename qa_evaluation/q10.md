## Agent Reasoning

**You spent $314.66 total (including $101.33 in tax) across 4 gas station receipts.**

Key receipts:
- 7-Eleven (2024-06-03): $100.00
- 7-Eleven (2023-07-26): $100.00
- Speedway: $14.66
- 7-Eleven (2023-07-26): $100.00

Average receipt: $78.67

## Shape

4 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**The total for all gas station visits is $314.66 across 4 receipts** (3 from 7-Eleven and 1 from Speedway).

Breakdown:
- 7-Eleven (ID: e0e74bc2-5acf-4dad-85ab-7e1d5f89cd6d:1): $100.00
- 7-Eleven (ID: 1746d34d-69e2-4764-ae52-4fc444e0a531:2): $100.00
- Speedway (ID: 1d5ab3e0-7d81-4de4-b23d-1f490f85d89c:1): $14.66
- 7-Eleven (ID: 49a1a1e7-348a-4cd9-af96-2312e838476e:2): $100.00

## Evaluation

**Grade:** B

**Correct Answer:** $314.66 across 4 gas_station-category receipts. This matches the agent's answer. The total is confirmed by `get_receipt_summaries` with `category_filter='gas_station'`, which returns: 7-Eleven $100.00, 7-Eleven $100.00, Speedway $14.66, 7-Eleven $100.00. Note that the Speedway receipt has category "premise" in the database but is still returned by the gas_station filter, likely via merchant-level category override.

**Tool Efficiency:** 1 call (optimal)

**Issues:**
1. The agent reported "Total tax paid: $101.33" without questioning it. One receipt (e0e74bc2) shows tax of $100.00 equal to its grand total, which is clearly a data labeling error. The real tax across these receipts is likely $1.33 (only the Speedway tobacco purchase had legitimate non-zero tax).
2. Two of the four receipts (1746d34d receipt 2 and 49a1a1e7 receipt 2) appear to be duplicates of the same transaction: same date (2023-07-26), same amount ($100.00). The agent did not flag this potential duplication, meaning the true total may be $214.66 across 3 unique visits.
3. The Speedway receipt ($14.66) is for tobacco ("AM SPIRIT PK REG BL" = American Spirit cigarettes), not fuel. Including it under "gas station visits" is reasonable given the question wording, but worth noting.
4. No verification was done for gas-related merchants that might be in other categories (e.g., convenience_store).

**Improvements from Baseline:**
The hybrid shaping fix had minimal impact on this question since only 4 receipts were involved (well within the old 5-receipt auto-fetch limit). The answer is identical to the baseline: same total ($314.66), same breakdown, same issues. The shape step now explicitly shows "4 receipts shaped" and the final answer is consistent with the agent reasoning -- there is no data loss between steps. The grade remains B because the core accuracy issues (suspicious tax, potential duplicates) are data quality problems, not shaping problems.
