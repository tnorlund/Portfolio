## Evaluation

**Grade:** B

**Tool Efficiency:** 1 call (optimal for basic answer)

**Correctness:**
- The total of $314.66 across 4 receipts matches the `get_receipt_summaries` output with `category_filter='gas_station'` and is confirmed correct.
- The per-receipt breakdown ($100.00, $100.00, $14.66, $100.00) is accurate.
- The merchant identification (7-Eleven x3, Speedway x1) is correct. All four are physically the same Speedway location at 5000 Kanan Rd, Agoura Hills, CA. Three are labeled "7-Eleven" (post-acquisition branding) and one as "Speedway".

**Issues:**
- The agent reported "Total tax paid: $101.33" without questioning it. One receipt shows tax of $100.00 equal to its grand total, which is clearly a data labeling error. The real tax across these receipts is likely $1.33 (only the Speedway tobacco purchase had non-zero tax).
- Two of the four receipts (`1746d34d` receipt 2 and `49a1a1e7` receipt 2) appear to be duplicates of the same transaction: same date (7/26/2023), same location, same amount ($100.00), same cashier (Hector T.), same transaction number (2009626). The agent did not flag this, which means the true total may be $214.66 across 3 unique visits.
- The Speedway receipt ($14.66) is for tobacco ("AM SPIRIT PK REG BL" = American Spirit cigarettes), not fuel. Including it under "gas station visits" is reasonable given the question wording, but worth noting.
- The agent did not cross-check other categories. Speedway's second receipt is categorized as `premise`, not `gas_station`, yet the tool still returned it -- the agent did not investigate or explain why.
- No verification was done for gas-related merchants that might be in other categories (e.g., convenience_store).

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Flag the suspicious $100 tax value on the first 7-Eleven receipt as likely erroneous.
- Detect and flag the duplicate receipt (same date, location, transaction number, and amount).
- Cross-check with text/semantic searches for "fuel", "diesel", "gallon" to ensure completeness.
- Clarify whether the question means "purchases at gas station locations" vs. "fuel purchases" -- the Speedway tobacco receipt is arguably not a gas purchase.
