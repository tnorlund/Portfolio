## Agent Reasoning

### Agent Step 2 (8000ms)

(empty -- initial reasoning)

### Agent Step 10 (8000ms)

You spent $0 on pet food. No receipts mention pet food items. Text searches for PET FOOD, DOG FOOD, CAT FOOD, KIBBLE, and PET SUPPLIES returned 0 results. Semantic search returned unrelated human food items with low similarity (~0.35-0.43). No pet stores (Petco, PetSmart) in merchant list.

## Shape

3 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**You spent $0 on pet food.**

No items matching pet food (e.g., dog food, cat food, kibble, or similar) appear in the provided receipts.

**Evidence:**
[]

### Evidence
[]

## Evaluation

**Grade:** A

**Correct Answer:** $0.00 spent on pet food. Independent verification confirms:
- Text search for "PET FOOD": 0 results
- Text search for "DOG FOOD": 0 results
- No pet store merchants (Petco, PetSmart, Chewy) appear in the 132 merchants
- No "pet_store" category among the 72 merchant categories
- Semantic search for "pet food" returns only unrelated human food items

**Tool Efficiency:** 7 calls (adequate -- 6 product searches + 1 merchant list check provides thorough confirmation of absence)

**Issues:**
None. The answer is correct. The agent appropriately concluded $0.00 after exhaustive searches across multiple relevant terms and confirmed the absence of pet store merchants.

**Improvements from Baseline:**
- The answer remains correct ($0.00), same as baseline.
- Tool efficiency is identical (7 calls in both runs) with the same search terms: PET FOOD (text + semantic), DOG FOOD, CAT FOOD, KIBBLE, PET SUPPLIES, and list_merchants.
- The final answer is more concise in the hybrid shaping run, which is appropriate for a null-result question.
- The shape step processed 3 receipts (vs 13 in baseline), which is irrelevant since the answer is correctly $0.00 regardless.
- The 3 shaped receipts (La La Land coffee, Sprouts groceries, Vons groceries) appear to be false positives from the semantic search that were correctly filtered out in the final answer.
- Grade improved from B to A: the baseline was graded B for "excessive" tool calls, but 7 calls is actually appropriate for a thorough absence confirmation. The agent needs to check multiple synonyms (pet food, dog food, cat food, kibble, pet supplies) and verify no pet stores exist in the merchant list to confidently report $0.00.
