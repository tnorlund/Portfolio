## Agent Reasoning

### Agent Step 2 (14000ms)

**You spent $0.00 on pet food.**

No receipts match pet food purchases. Exact text searches for "PET FOOD", "DOG FOOD", "CAT FOOD", and "KIBBLE" returned zero results. Semantic searches for "pet food", "dog food", and "cat food" surfaced unrelated human food items (e.g., eggs at Vons/Sprouts for $10.99, ground beef, poultry, Cheerios) with low similarity scores (max ~0.47), but nothing pet-related like dog/cat kibble, treats, or purchases from pet stores (Petco, PetSmart, Chewy).


## Shape

13 receipts shaped

## Final Answer

**You spent $0.00 on pet food.**

No receipts mention pet food or related items (e.g., dog food, cat food, kibble, or pet-specific products). All listed items appear to be human groceries, meats, dairy, or beverages.

**Evidence:**  
[]

## Evaluation

**Grade:** B

**Tool Efficiency:** 7 calls (2-3 would suffice)

**Correctness:** The agent correctly determined $0.00 was spent on pet food. Independent verification confirms no pet food products, no pet store merchants (Petco, PetSmart), and no pet_store category among 72 merchant categories. Semantic search results had max similarity of ~0.47, all clearly unrelated human food items.

**Issues:**
- 7 tool calls is excessive for a null-result query. After "PET FOOD" text search and "pet food" semantic search both returned nothing relevant, the additional 5 searches (DOG FOOD, CAT FOOD, KIBBLE text + dog food, cat food semantic) were redundant and added no new information.
- The agent did not check for pet store merchants or the pet_store category, which would have been a more efficient way to confirm the absence of pet-related purchases.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Start with 1 broad semantic search ("pet food pet supplies") and 1 text search ("PET FOOD"). If both return nothing relevant, conclude $0.00 without further searches.
- Check merchant categories (list_categories) for pet_store as a quick confirmation rather than running multiple product-line searches.
- A null result should be achievable in 2-3 calls, not 7.
