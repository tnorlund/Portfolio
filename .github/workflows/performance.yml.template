# Performance Testing Workflow Template
# 
# This workflow was developed for the ChromaDB integration but temporarily
# removed to keep the PR focused on core functionality. It can be re-enabled
# in a future PR dedicated to performance monitoring improvements.
#
# To implement this workflow:
# 1. Rename this file from .template to .yml
# 2. Set up the required secrets (LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN)
# 3. Ensure portfolio package.json has the required scripts:
#    - npm run analyze:bundle
#    - npm run test:e2e:perf
# 4. Install required dependencies in portfolio/:
#    - @lhci/cli for Lighthouse CI
#    - Playwright for performance testing
#
# Features provided by this workflow:
# - Lighthouse CI for Core Web Vitals monitoring
# - Playwright-based performance regression testing
# - Bundle size analysis with PR comments
# - Daily scheduled performance monitoring
# - Performance regression detection between PR and main branch
