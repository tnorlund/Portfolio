1. **Workflow Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names that indicate purpose
2. **Concurrency**: Use concurrency groups to prevent duplicate runs
3. **Permissions**: Follow principle of least privilege
4. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Use path filters to avoid unnecessary runs
   - Implement size checks for AI reviews
   - Cache dependencies effectively
5. **Status Checks**: Ensure critical workflows provide status checks for branch protection

## Manual Triggers

Several workflows support manual triggers:
