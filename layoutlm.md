Previous LayoutLM Training Architecture Review

üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Setup (Commented out in infra/**main**.py)

MLPackageBuilder Component:

- Built packages using AWS CodeBuild in VPC environment
- Created wheels for receipt_trainer and receipt_dynamo packages
- Deployed to EFS for shared access across EC2 instances
- Used Python 3.12 with GPU-optimized build environment

Training Infrastructure:

- GPU Instances: p3.2xlarge spot instances for cost optimization
- Job Queue: SQS FIFO queue for job distribution and ordering
- Storage: EFS for checkpoints, S3 for model artifacts
- Coordination: DynamoDB for job state tracking and instance management

üì¶ Package Structure Analysis

Two Versions Found:

1. receipt_trainer_1/ - Full-featured, production-ready package
2. receipt_trainer/ - Minimal stub (only has create_dataset.py)

üéØ Training Approach (receipt_trainer_1/)

Model Configuration:

- Base Model: Microsoft LayoutLM (microsoft/layoutlm-base-uncased)
- Task: Token classification for receipt field extraction
- Architecture: LayoutLM v2 with 512 max sequence length
- Labels: Receipt entities (MERCHANT_NAME, DATE, TOTAL, PRODUCT_NAME, etc.)

Training Configuration:
Training Setup:

- Batch size: 8 (with gradient accumulation steps: 4)
- Learning rate: 5e-5 with warmup
- Epochs: 10-20
- Early stopping: patience=3 on val_f1
- Mixed precision: enabled
- Spot instance: enabled for cost savings

Data Pipeline:

- Sources: DynamoDB receipts + SROIE dataset
- Preprocessing: Sliding windows (512 tokens, 128 overlap)
- Augmentation: Rotation, scaling, noise
- Balancing: Target 70% entity tokens

üîÑ Job Management System

Sophisticated Orchestration:

1. Job Definition: YAML configs with resource requirements
2. Queue Management: SQS FIFO with DynamoDB state tracking
3. Spot Handling: Graceful interruption with emergency checkpoints
4. Recovery: Resume from checkpoints on instance restart
5. Monitoring: Real-time metrics to DynamoDB

Key Features:

- Distributed training capability
- Hyperparameter sweeps
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth
- Comprehensive error handling
- Cost optimization with spot instances

üìä Data Sources

Training Data:

- Primary: DynamoDB receipt words with validated labels
- Secondary: SROIE dataset (receipt understanding benchmark)
- Validation: Separate validated dataset from DynamoDB
- Format: Token-level BIO tagging for NER

üéõÔ∏è Advanced Features

Enterprise-Grade Capabilities:

- Multi-GPU distributed training
- Checkpoint management with S3 backup
- Comprehensive metrics (F1, precision, recall, confusion matrices)
- Integration with existing DynamoDB schema
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Cost monitoring and optimization

‚ùå Current State

Infrastructure Status:

- ‚úÖ Code exists and is well-documented
- ‚ùå Infrastructure is commented out (not deployed)
- ‚ùå Current receipt_trainer package is minimal stub
- ‚ùå No active training jobs or models

üîÑ Why It Was Stopped

Based on the commented infrastructure, likely reasons:

1. Cost concerns - GPU instances and storage costs
2. Complexity management - Sophisticated but maintenance-heavy
3. Alternative approaches - May have switched to different training methods
4. Resource constraints - VPC/networking complexity

üí° Key Strengths of Previous Approach

1. Production-Ready: Full enterprise features
2. Cost-Optimized: Spot instances, auto-scaling
3. Fault-Tolerant: Checkpoint recovery, graceful interruptions
4. Scalable: Distributed training, queue management
5. Comprehensive: End-to-end ML pipeline

The previous approach was a sophisticated, production-grade LayoutLM training system that could
handle enterprise-scale receipt processing with proper cost optimization and fault tolerance. It's
currently dormant but could be reactivated with proper infrastructure provisioning.
