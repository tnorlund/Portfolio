# Threading Deadlock Fix - ChromaDB Compaction Lock Manager

## Issue Summary

The ChromaDB compaction Lambda was experiencing consistent 15-minute timeouts due to a threading deadlock in the `LockManager` class. The Lambda would hang at "Validating lock ownership before label updates" and never complete processing.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Misdiagnosis
Initially suspected a datetime parsing issue in `validate_ownership()` because:
- Lambda timed out during lock validation
- DynamoDB returns `expires` field as ISO string, code expected datetime object
- Added datetime conversion fix but issue persisted

### Actual Root Cause: Recursive Lock Deadlock

The real issue was a **recursive lock deadlock** in the same thread:

```python
def update_heartbeat(self) -> bool:
    with self._lock:  # Thread acquires lock
        # ... code ...
        if not self.validate_ownership():  # Calls validate_ownership()
            return False

def validate_ownership(self) -> bool:
    with self._lock:  # DEADLOCK: Same thread tries to acquire same lock again
        # ... never reached ...
```

**Execution Flow Leading to Deadlock:**
1. Heartbeat thread starts and calls `update_heartbeat()`
2. `update_heartbeat()` acquires `self._lock` (line 235)
3. `update_heartbeat()` calls `validate_ownership()` (line 242) 
4. `validate_ownership()` tries to acquire `self._lock` (line 386)
5. **DEADLOCK**: Same thread waiting for itself to release the lock

## Evidence

### Lambda Logs Pattern
```
23:16:35.147 - "Validating lock ownership before label updates"
23:17:05.002 - "Lambda heartbeat" (30+ seconds later)
23:17:35.035 - "Lambda heartbeat"
... (continues for 15 minutes until timeout)
```

### Key Indicators
- ✅ Lock acquisition worked: `"Acquired lock: chroma-words-update-1756250195"`
- ✅ Heartbeat thread started: `"Heartbeat worker thread started"`
- ❌ **No debug messages from inside `validate_ownership()`** - method never executed
- ❌ **No "TEMP DEBUG" datetime parsing messages** - never reached that code
- ❌ Only timeout handler heartbeats continued

### Local Reproduction
```python
# Direct DynamoDB test showed the issue was NOT network/permissions:
client = DynamoClient("ReceiptsTable-dc5be22")
result = client.get_compaction_lock("chroma-words-update-1756250195", ChromaDBCollection.WORDS)
# Completed in 0.10s successfully ✅
```

## Solution

### 1. Change Lock Type (Immediate Fix)
```python
# Before (line 96):
self._lock = threading.Lock()

# After:
self._lock = threading.RLock()  # Allows recursive acquisition by same thread
```

### 2. Remove Redundant Validation (Performance Improvement)
```python
# Before (lines 241-246):
if not self.validate_ownership():
    logger.error("Lock ownership validation failed during heartbeat update")
    return False

# After:
# Note: Heartbeat updates don't need ownership validation as they're 
# designed to maintain an existing valid lock
```

### Why This Fix Works

1. **`threading.RLock()` (Reentrant Lock)**:
   - Allows the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times
   - Maintains a count of acquisitions and requires equal releases
   - Eliminates recursive deadlock while preserving thread safety

2. **Removing Redundant Validation**:
   - Heartbeat updates are meant to maintain existing locks, not validate ownership
   - Reduces unnecessary DynamoDB calls and potential failure points
   - Improves performance by eliminating recursive method calls

## Files Modified

1. **`receipt_label/receipt_label/utils/lock_manager.py`**:
   - Line 96: Changed `threading.Lock()` to `threading.RLock()`
   - Lines 241-246: Removed redundant `validate_ownership()` call from `update_heartbeat()`

## Testing Approach

### Before Fix
- ✅ Lambda consistently timed out at 15 minutes
- ✅ Hanging occurred at "Validating lock ownership before label updates"
- ✅ No application logs beyond initial setup

### After Fix (Expected)
- ✅ Lambda completes within normal timeframe (seconds, not minutes)
- ✅ `validate_ownership()` executes and produces debug logs
- ✅ ChromaDB metadata updates proceed normally

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### 1. Separate Locks for Different Operations
```python
self._state_lock = threading.Lock()      # For local state
self._validation_lock = threading.Lock()  # For validation operations
```
**Pros**: More granular control
**Cons**: Increased complexity, potential for other deadlocks

### 2. Lock-Free State Management
```python
# Use atomic operations or thread-local storage
```
**Pros**: No deadlock risk
**Cons**: Major architectural change, harder to reason about

### 3. Remove All Locking from DynamoDB Operations
```python
# Only lock around local state changes, not during I/O
```
**Pros**: Better performance, no I/O blocking
**Cons**: Potential race conditions in state management

**Decision**: Chose `RLock()` solution for minimal code change with maximum safety.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Thread Deadlocks Can Be Subtle**: The recursive nature made this hard to spot initially
2. **Local Testing Helps Eliminate Variables**: Proved DynamoDB access wasn't the issue
3. **Log Analysis is Critical**: Absence of expected logs indicated where execution stopped
4. **Consider Threading Patterns in Design**: Avoid holding locks during I/O operations when possible

## Related Issues

- **Datetime Parsing Fix**: Still valid and needed, but wasn't causing the timeout
- **S3 Atomic Upload Investigation**: On hold until basic operation is stable

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:
- ✅ Lambda execution times return to normal (< 30 seconds)
- ✅ Successful completion of metadata updates
- ✅ Appearance of debug logs from `validate_ownership()`
- ❌ Any new threading issues or race conditions
