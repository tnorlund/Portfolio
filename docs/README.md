# Documentation Index

Welcome to the Portfolio & Receipt Processing System documentation. This directory collects the living architecture, operations, research, and historical runbooks we need to operate the system.

## 🔍 Key Sections

- **Architecture** (`architecture/`, `architecture-decisions/`, `design-decisions/`)
  - `architecture/overview.md` provides the current service map, deployment layers, and cost/monitoring highlights.
  - The ADR folders document major decisions and long-running projects where the team needs to capture intent.

- **Development** (`development/`)
  - Onboarding, CI/CD notes, and the centralized `development/testing.md`.

- **Operations** (`operations/`)
  - Deployment runbooks, monitoring playbooks, and cost/regulation guidance (e.g., `operations/deployment.md`).

- **Research & Models** (`layoutlm/`)
  - LayoutLM experiments, training notes, and inference insights.

- **Types & APIs** (`types/`)
  - API contracts and shared type notes that back the frontend/portfolio docs.

- **Archive** (`archive/`)
  - Historical work is kept behind this space; see `docs/archive/legacy-ai-usage/` for the removed AI usage docs and the rest of the archive for older investigations.

- **Special Reports**
  - Everything starting with `CHROMADB_*`, `DELTA_*`, `INGESTION_*`, `PULUMI_*`, etc., lives in the root alongside the directories to highlight system reports from weekly/epic work.
