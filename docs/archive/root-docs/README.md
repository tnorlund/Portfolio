# Archived Root Documentation

This directory contains markdown files that were previously in the repository root but have been archived for better organization.

## Directory Structure

- **`status/`** - Implementation status and progress tracking documents
- **`analysis/`** - Technical analysis and flow documentation
- **`planning/`** - Migration plans and deployment planning documents
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - AI assistant context (now managed via .cursorrules)

## Why Archived?

These documents were moved here because they are:
- Historical records of completed work
- Implementation status snapshots
- Planning documents for completed migrations
- Technical analyses that have been superseded by current documentation

For current, active documentation, see:
- [`../architecture/`](../architecture/) - Current architecture documentation
- [`../development/`](../development/) - Current development guides
- [`../operations/` railroads](../operations/) - Current operations guides
