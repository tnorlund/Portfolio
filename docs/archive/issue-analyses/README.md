# Archived Incident & Execution Analyses

This folder holds root-level `*.md` reports that were moved during the docs cleanup because they cover specific runs, incidents, or one-off experiments that no longer map to the active workflow.

Contents include:

- `CHUNK_*` files describing chunking failures and fixes.
- `EXECUTION_*` files with detailed batch/step-function traces and failure investigations.
- Merge/rebuild notes such as `FINAL_MERGE_OPTIMIZATION_PROPOSAL.md`, `FINAL_MERGE_RESULT_PRESERVATION.md`, `FORCE_REBUILD_EXPLANATION.md`, and `GRAND_TOTAL_VALIDATION_PATTERNS.md`.

Use these docs for historical context when debugging regressions tied to those incident IDs, but otherwise keep new documentation in the living directories.
