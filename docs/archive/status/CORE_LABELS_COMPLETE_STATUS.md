## Labels Being Extracted vs Stored

### What's Extracted (16 labels)
All labels are extracted from the **receipt text** via LangGraph + Ollama:
- This finds the **words on the receipt image** and labels them
- Enables word-level annotation and visualization
- Creates ReceiptWordLabel entities in DynamoDB

### What's Also in ReceiptMetadata (Validation Only)
These are in ReceiptMetadata from Google Places API:
- MERCHANT_NAME (validated canonical name)
- PHONE_NUMBER (validated number)
- ADDRESS_LINE (validated address)

**Key Point**: We extract MERCHANT_NAME, PHONE_NUMBER, ADDRESS_LINE from receipt text to label the actual words on the image. ReceiptMetadata provides the validated/standardized values for comparison.
