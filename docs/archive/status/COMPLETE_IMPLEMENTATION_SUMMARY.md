## Why Extract MERCHANT_NAME, PHONE_NUMBER, ADDRESS_LINE?

**Because we need to label the actual words on the receipt!**

Even though ReceiptMetadata has these values from Google Places:
- We still need to find and label the corresponding words on the receipt image
- This enables:
  - Word-level annotations for visualization
  - Training data for future models
  - Display/highlighting of merchant info on the receipt image

**ReceiptMetadata provides**: Validated, canonical merchant data  
**LangGraph extracts**: Word-level labels on the receipt image

Both are needed! ‚úÖ

## Complete CORE_LABELS Coverage

### Extracting via LangGraph (16 labels)

From receipt text:
- Currency: GRAND_TOTAL, TAX, SUBTOTAL, LINE_TOTAL
- Line Items: PRODUCT_NAME, QUANTITY, UNIT_PRICE  
- Transaction: DATE, TIME, PAYMENT_METHOD, COUPON, DISCOUNT, LOYALTY_ID
- **Merchant: MERCHANT_NAME, PHONE_NUMBER, ADDRESS_LINE** ‚Üê NEW!

### Provided by ReceiptMetadata (for validation/comparison only)
- MERCHANT_NAME (validated)
- PHONE_NUMBER (validated)
- ADDRESS_LINE (validated)

## Architecture

```
LangGraph extracts word-level labels on receipt image:
  COSTCO ‚Üí MERCHANT_NAME (word on receipt)
  
ReceiptMetadata provides validated merchant info:
  merchant_name = "Costco Wholesale" (canonical, validated)
```

**Both serve different purposes** - word labeling vs validation! ‚úÖ
