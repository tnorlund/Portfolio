# CORE_LABELS Implementation Status

## ✅ Current Implementation (13 labels)

### Phase 1: Currency Analysis
- ✅ GRAND_TOTAL - Final amount due
- ✅ TAX - Tax lines
- ✅ SUBTOTAL - Sum before tax
- ✅ LINE_TOTAL - Line item totals

### Phase 1 Context: Transaction Analysis (NEW - IN PROGRESS)
- ⏳ DATE - Calendar date of transaction
- ⏳ TIME - Time of transaction
- ⏳ PAYMENT_METHOD - Payment instrument
- ⏳ COUPON - Coupon codes
- ⏳ DISCOUNT - Discount amounts
- ⏳ LOYALTY_ID - Member/rewards ID

### Phase 2: Line Items
- ✅ PRODUCT_NAME - Item names
- ✅ QUANTITY - Count/weight
- ✅ UNIT_PRICE - Price per unit

---

## Already Provided by ReceiptMetadata

These don't need to be extracted from receipt text:
- ✅ MERCHANT_NAME (from Google Places)
- ✅ PHONE_NUMBER (from Google Places)
- ✅ ADDRESS_LINE (from Google Places)

## Strategy: CORE_LABELS as Single Source of Truth

**Key Principle**: Descriptions live once in `receipt_label/constants.py` in the `CORE_LABELS` dictionary.

### Usage in Code

```python
from receipt_label.constants import CORE_LABELS

# Get description from CORE_LABELS
date_description = CORE_LABELS["DATE"]
# Output: "Calendar date of the transaction."

# Use in prompts
subset_definitions = "\n".join(
    f"- {label}: {CORE_LABELS.get(label, 'N/A')}" 
    for label in subset 
    if label in CORE_LABELS
)
```

### Benefits

1. **No Duplication** - Descriptions defined once
2. **Consistency** - Same descriptions everywhere
3. **Easy Updates** - Change CORE_LABELS once, affects all uses
4. **Maintainability** - Clear source of truth

## Next Steps

1. **Update combine_results** to include transaction_labels
2. **Update label mapping** to handle TransactionLabel objects
3. **Load ReceiptMetadata** into state for merchant context
4. **Test and validate** transaction label extraction

---

## Testing

```bash
python dev.test_simple_currency_validation.py
```

**Expected**: Transaction labels extracted in parallel with currency labels
