## Not Extracted (23 labels)

### Provided by ReceiptMetadata ‚úÖ
These are loaded from Google Places API, not extracted from receipt text:

- ‚úÖ **MERCHANT_NAME** - From ReceiptMetadata.merchant_name
- ‚úÖ **PHONE_NUMBER** - From ReceiptMetadata.phone_number
- ‚úÖ **ADDRESS_LINE** - From ReceiptMetadata.address

**Rationale**: These are merchant-specific, not transaction-specific. ReceiptMetadata already has them validated from Google Places.

### Low Value / Skip (20 labels)

#### Store Information
- ‚ùå **STORE_HOURS** - Rarely useful for users
- ‚ùå **WEBSITE** - Low value, often outdated

**Rationale**: Users don't need this info for expense tracking.
