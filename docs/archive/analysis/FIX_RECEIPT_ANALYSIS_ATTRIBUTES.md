# Fix: ReceiptAnalysis Missing Attributes

## Error
```
"ReceiptAnalysis" object has no field "receipt_word_labels_to_add"
```

## Problem
We added attributes dynamically in `currency_validation.py` but Pydantic models don't allow that. Need to add these fields to the actual model.

## Solution
Add the fields to `ReceiptAnalysis` Pydantic model in `models/currency_validation.py`
