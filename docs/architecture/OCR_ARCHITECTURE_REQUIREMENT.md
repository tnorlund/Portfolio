# OCR Architecture Requirement

## Why We Must Continue Using OCR

### Current Architecture (REQUIRED)

```
Receipt Image → OCR (LayoutLM) → Text → LangGraph → Labels
```

### Decision: Keep OCR Pipeline ✅

**Why OCR is Required**:

1. **Existing Infrastructure Investment**
   - We have a working LayoutLM OCR pipeline
   - OCR data is already stored in DynamoDB
   - Switching would require massive data migration

2. **Fine-Tuned Model**
   - LayoutLM is trained specifically on receipt images
   - Achieves high accuracy for structured data extraction
   - Vision models are general-purpose, not receipt-specific

3. **Spatial Information**
   - OCR captures position (line_id, word_id) for each word
   - This spatial data is essential for LangGraph analysis
   - Vision models would lose this positional metadata

4. **Cost Efficiency**
   - OCR is one-time extraction, stored in DynamoDB
   - LangGraph runs multiple times on same OCR data
   - Vision models would re-analyze image every time

5. **Batch Processing**
   - OCR runs asynchronously once per image
   - LangGraph can process multiple receipts from stored OCR
   - Vision models would require image access every time

### When to Use Vision Models

Vision models are **NOT suitable** for this use case because:
- ❌ We don't have continuous access to original images
- ❌ Would require re-downloading images from S3 for every analysis
- ❌ Loses spatial metadata we rely on
- ❌ More expensive (repeat image processing)
- ❌ Slower (network latency for image retrieval)

### Architecture Benefit

```
✅ Current: OCR once → LangGraph many times (on stored data)
❌ Vision: Re-analyze image for every LangGraph run
```

**Result**: Current approach is more efficient and cost-effective at scale.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Vision Models (REJECTED ❌)
- **Pros**: Single step, potentially simpler
- **Cons**: 
  - Lose spatial metadata (line_id, word_id)
  - Re-process images repeatedly
  - Requires image retrieval from S3 every time
  - More expensive at scale

### Option 2: Keep OCR + LangGraph (SELECTED ✅)
- **Pros**: 
  - Spatial metadata preserved
  - One OCR, many analyses
  - Cost efficient
  - Fast (no image retrieval)
- **Cons**: Two-step process

---

## Conclusion

**We MUST continue using OCR** because:
1. Provides essential spatial metadata
2. More cost-efficient at scale
3. Works with existing architecture
4. Better for batch processing
5. Trained specifically for receipts

**Vision models would be a regression**, not an improvement.
