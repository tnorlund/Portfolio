# Merchant Validation Agent Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the current merchant validation agent and identifies opportunities for cost optimization through pattern-based pre-filtering.

## Current Merchant Validation Flow

### Architecture
The current system uses a sophisticated GPT-powered agent with Google Places API tools:

```python
# Current workflow (receipt_label/merchant_validation/agent.py)
MerchantValidationAgent:
  1. Extract candidate fields from OCR words
  2. Run GPT agent with Google Places API tools:
     - search_by_phone() → Google Places API call
     - search_by_address() → Google Places API call  
     - search_nearby() → Google Places API call
     - search_by_text() → Google Places API call
  3. Agent reasoning with GPT model (multiple turns)
  4. Final validation decision via GPT
```

### Cost Analysis per Receipt

| Component | Cost Range | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| GPT Agent calls | $0.01-0.03 | Multiple turns + reasoning |
| Google Places API | $0.002-0.008 | 3-4 calls per receipt |
| **Total per receipt** | **$0.012-0.038** | Current cost |

### Success/Failure Modes

**Success Path:**
```python
metadata = {
    "place_id": "ChIJ...",
    "merchant_name": "WALMART SUPERCENTER", 
    "address": "123 Main St...",
    "validated_by": "PLACES_API_PHONE",  # or ADDRESS, TEXT, etc.
    "reasoning": "Matched on phone number..."
}
```

**Failure Path:**
- Falls back to partial results from individual API calls
- Eventually returns NO_MATCH if all approaches fail
- Includes failure context and reasoning

## Optimization Opportunity: Pattern Pre-filtering

### Key Insight
**Most receipts are from repeat merchants!** Common chains like Walmart, Target, CVS appear frequently with predictable patterns.

### Proposed Approach

#### Strategy A: Pattern-Based Pre-filter
```python
def intelligent_merchant_validation(receipt_words: List[ReceiptWord]):
    # Step 1: Quick pattern-based merchant detection
    merchant_patterns = extract_merchant_indicators(receipt_words)
    # Look for: store numbers, phone patterns, address patterns
    
    # Step 2: Check against known merchant patterns  
    quick_match = query_known_merchant_patterns(merchant_patterns)
    
    if quick_match and quick_match.confidence > 0.95:
        # HIGH confidence → Skip expensive agent, use pattern
        return build_metadata_from_pattern(quick_match)
    else:
        # LOW confidence → Fall back to current expensive agent
        return run_current_agent_validation(receipt_words)
```

#### Strategy B: Hierarchical Validation
```python
def tiered_merchant_validation(receipt_words: List[ReceiptWord]):
    # Tier 1: Exact text matches (cheapest - $0.001)
    exact_match = check_exact_merchant_name_patterns(receipt_words)
    if exact_match: return exact_match
    
    # Tier 2: Phone/address patterns (medium cost - $0.005)
    phone_address_match = check_phone_address_patterns(receipt_words)
    if phone_address_match: return phone_address_match
    
    # Tier 3: Full agent validation (expensive - $0.02-0.04)
    return run_current_agent_validation(receipt_words)
```

### Potential Cost Savings

**Assumptions:**
- 70% of receipts are from repeat merchants
- Pattern matching cost: ~$0.001 per receipt
- Current agent cost: ~$0.025 per receipt average

**Savings Calculation:**
- Current: 100% × $0.025 = $0.025 per receipt
- With patterns: (70% × $0.001) + (30% × $0.025) = $0.0082 per receipt
- **Savings: 67% reduction** (~$0.017 per receipt)

At 10,000 receipts/month: **$170/month savings**

## Pattern Types to Extract

Based on analysis of the current agent's field extraction, we could add:

### 1. Store Number Patterns
- Walmart: "ST# 1234", "STORE #1234"
- Target: "TARGET T-5678"
- CVS: "CVS/PHARMACY #9012"

### 2. Phone Number Patterns
- Chain-specific phone number formats
- Known corporate numbers vs store-specific

### 3. Address Patterns
- Known store locations from previous validations
- Chain-specific address formatting

### 4. Receipt Format Signatures
- Header layouts unique to merchants
- Footer patterns (return policies, websites)

## Integration Design Options

### Option A: Wrapper Approach (Recommended)
```python
# New wrapper that tries patterns first
def smart_merchant_validation(image_id, receipt_id, receipt_words):
    # Try pattern matching first
    pattern_result = check_merchant_patterns(receipt_words)
    
    if pattern_result.confidence > CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
        return pattern_result.to_receipt_metadata()
    else:
        # Fall back to current agent (unchanged)
        handler = MerchantValidationHandler(api_key)
        return handler.validate_receipt_merchant(...)
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal changes to existing system
- Easy to A/B test and rollback
- Preserves current agent as reliable fallback

### Option B: Agent Enhancement
```python
# Enhance existing agent with pattern tools
class EnhancedMerchantValidationAgent(MerchantValidationAgent):
    def _create_agent(self):
        tools = [
            self._create_pattern_search_tool(),  # NEW: Pattern matching
            self._create_search_by_phone_tool(),
            # ... existing tools
        ]
```

**Pros:**
- Single unified system
- Agent can use patterns as additional context

**Cons:**
- More complex changes to existing agent
- Harder to measure pattern-specific performance

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pattern Collection (Future Epic)
- Extract and store merchant patterns from validated receipts
- Build pattern database with confidence scores
- Analyze pattern effectiveness on historical data

### Phase 2: Simple Pre-filter (Future Epic)
- Implement exact text matching for top 20 merchants
- Measure cost savings and accuracy
- Tune confidence thresholds

### Phase 3: Advanced Patterns (Future Epic)
- Add store numbers, phone patterns, address patterns
- Implement learning from validation feedback
- Full integration with agent fallback

### Phase 4: Production Optimization (Future Epic)
- A/B testing of different confidence thresholds
- Performance monitoring and cost tracking
- Continuous pattern learning pipeline

## Decision Points

1. **Confidence Threshold**: What confidence level (90%? 95%? 98%) justifies skipping the agent?

2. **Pattern Storage**: DynamoDB vs in-memory cache vs external pattern service?

3. **Learning Strategy**: How to update patterns based on validation feedback?

4. **Fallback Policy**: Always use agent on pattern failures, or have multiple fallback tiers?

## Conclusion

The current merchant validation agent is sophisticated and reliable, but expensive for repeat merchants. A pattern-based pre-filter could reduce costs by 60-70% while maintaining accuracy through intelligent fallbacks.

The key is implementing this incrementally, starting with simple exact matches and gradually adding more sophisticated pattern recognition as we learn from production data.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create new Epic for pattern pre-filtering
2. Start with pattern collection and analysis
3. Implement simple exact-match pre-filter
4. Gradually enhance with more sophisticated patterns
