# Design a Smart Decision Engine for Receipt Labeling System

## Context

You are tasked with designing a Smart Decision Engine for a receipt labeling system. The goal is to determine when pattern detection alone is sufficient for labeling receipt words versus when GPT/LLM assistance is needed, targeting an 84% reduction in AI API costs.

## Important Files to Review

Please read these files in order to understand the system:

### 1. Context Documentation
- **Primary Context**: `/receipt_label/docs/decision-engine-design-context.md` - Comprehensive background on current capabilities, requirements, and constraints
- **Design Prompt**: `/receipt_label/docs/decision-engine-design-prompt.md` - Structured requirements for your design

### 2. Pattern Detection Implementation (Current State)
- **Enhanced Orchestrator**: `/receipt_label/receipt_label/pattern_detection/enhanced_orchestrator.py` - Main entry point showing pattern detection output format
- **Pattern Registry**: `/receipt_label/receipt_label/pattern_detection/pattern_registry.py` - Available pattern detectors and their capabilities
- **Test Script**: `/receipt_label/scripts/test_pattern_detection_local.py` - Shows how pattern detection is used

### 3. Core System Components
- **Label Definitions**: `/receipt_label/receipt_label/constants.py` - Contains CORE_LABELS dictionary with all possible labels
- **Noise Detection**: `/receipt_label/receipt_label/utils/noise_detection.py` - Logic for identifying noise words to skip
- **Data Structures**: `/receipt_dynamo/receipt_dynamo/entities/receipt_word.py` and `receipt_word_label.py` - Core data models

### 4. Performance Results
- **Test Results**: `/receipt_label/pattern_detection_performance_report.md` - Real performance metrics from 47 production receipts
- **Cost Analysis**: Review the performance metrics showing 0.49ms average processing time

## Your Task

Design a comprehensive Smart Decision Engine that:

1. **Analyzes pattern detection results** to determine if they provide sufficient labeling coverage
2. **Decides whether to call GPT** based on configurable thresholds and business rules
3. **Optimizes GPT usage** when it IS needed by focusing only on unlabeled words
4. **Provides clear reasoning** for its decisions to enable monitoring and debugging

## Key Requirements

1. **Essential Labels**: Must detect MERCHANT_NAME, DATE, and GRAND_TOTAL
2. **Performance**: Decision must be made in <10ms
3. **Flexibility**: Thresholds must be configurable without code changes
4. **Integration**: Must work with existing pattern detection output format
5. **Monitoring**: Must provide metrics for tracking success rate and cost savings

## Deliverables

Please provide:

1. **Detailed Design Document** including:
   - Class/module architecture with clear interfaces
   - Decision algorithm flowchart
   - Data structures and schemas
   - Integration points with existing system

2. **Implementation Specification**:
   - Core classes and methods with docstrings
   - Configuration schema (YAML/JSON)
   - Error handling strategy
   - Logging and monitoring approach

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit test scenarios
   - Integration test plan
   - Performance benchmarks
   - A/B testing framework

4. **Deployment Plan**:
   - Rollout phases
   - Feature flags/toggles
   - Rollback strategy
   - Success metrics

## Example Pattern Detection Output

Here's what the decision engine receives from pattern detection:

```python
{
    "detected_patterns": [
        {
            "receipt_word_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
            "text": "WALMART",
            "label": "MERCHANT_NAME",
            "confidence": 0.95,
            "pattern_type": "merchant",
            "metadata": {"source": "header_position"}
        },
        {
            "receipt_word_id": "6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8",
            "text": "$12.99",
            "label": "LINE_TOTAL",
            "confidence": 0.85,
            "pattern_type": "currency",
            "metadata": {"currency_type": "total", "position_percentile": 0.65}
        }
    ],
    "processing_time_ms": 0.49,
    "optimization_stats": {
        "total_words": 127,
        "patterns_evaluated": 15,
        "detectors_used": ["currency", "datetime", "merchant"]
    }
}
```

## Success Criteria

Your design will be evaluated on:
1. **Feasibility** of achieving 84% GPT skip rate
2. **Robustness** of decision logic across receipt types
3. **Maintainability** of the implementation
4. **Monitoring** capabilities for continuous improvement
5. **Integration** simplicity with existing systems
