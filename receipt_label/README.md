# Receipt Label

A Python package for labeling and validating receipt data using GPT and Pinecone.

## Package Responsibilities

**IMPORTANT**: This package handles business logic and AI integrations. It must NOT contain DynamoDB-specific code.

### What belongs in receipt_label:
- ‚úÖ Receipt labeling and analysis logic
- ‚úÖ AI service integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- ‚úÖ Pinecone vector database operations
- ‚úÖ Google Places API integration
- ‚úÖ Label validation and correction logic

### What does NOT belong here:
- ‚ùå Direct DynamoDB operations (use receipt_dynamo interfaces)
- ‚ùå DynamoDB retry logic or resilience patterns (use ResilientDynamoClient from receipt_dynamo)
- ‚ùå DynamoDB batch processing logic (use receipt_dynamo's batch methods)
- ‚ùå OCR text extraction (belongs in receipt_ocr)

### Example: Proper DynamoDB Usage
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use receipt_dynamo's high-level interfaces
from receipt_dynamo import ResilientDynamoClient

client = ResilientDynamoClient(table_name="my-table")
client.put_ai_usage_metric(metric)  # Let receipt_dynamo handle resilience

# ‚ùå WRONG: Don't implement DynamoDB logic here
def put_with_retry(item):
    for attempt in range(3):  # This belongs in receipt_dynamo!
        try:
            dynamo.put_item(...)
        except:
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
```

## Embedding Strategy

For each receipt word, we generate two embeddings to capture both semantic and spatial context:

1. **Word-level embedding**

   - Text: `<word> [label=ITEM_NAME] (pos=top-left)`
   - Captures the token‚Äôs semantic content and its key attributes in a single vector.

2. **Context-level embedding**
   - Text: the concatenated words with similar Y-position (using `get_hybrid_context`)
   - Captures layout and neighboring-word relationships to provide visual context.

**Purpose:**

- The dual embeddings enrich prompts by retrieving both token-level and line-level examples from Pinecone.
- Semantic neighbors (word view) help validate the token‚Äôs meaning in isolation.
- Context neighbors (context view) help validate how the token is used in layout (e.g., line items, addresses).

**Metadata Updates:**

- On the **valid** path: update each embedding‚Äôs metadata with `status: VALID`.
- On the **invalid** path: update metadata with `status: INVALID` and add `proposed_label: <new_label>`.
- We reuse the same vector IDs so we never duplicate embeddings‚Äîonly metadata changes.

This approach allows agentic, data‚Äëdriven validation and label proposal, while keeping Pinecone storage efficient and easy to query.

## Label Validation Strategy

## üß™ Label Validation Strategy

This project uses a layered, multi-pass approach to label validation in order to combine efficiency, semantic similarity, and multi-hop reasoning.

### üîπ Pass 1: Batch Label Validation with GPT

All `ReceiptWordLabel` entries are processed via batch completions using OpenAI‚Äôs function calling. GPT evaluates each label in context and flags whether it is valid. If the label is deemed incorrect, it may suggest a corrected label and provide a rationale. This step is fully parallelizable using the OpenAI Batch API.

### üîπ Pass 2: Embedding-Based Refinement

For any labels marked as invalid in the first pass, a second evaluation is conducted using Pinecone. The model is provided with:

- The word and its receipt context
- The original and GPT-suggested labels
- A list of nearby Pinecone embeddings with known correct labels

GPT uses this expanded semantic context to reconsider its earlier assessment. This step improves precision on edge cases like numbers, prepositions, or ambiguous merchant terms.

## üîπ Pass 3: Agentic Label Resolution

The final pass uses the OpenAI Agents SDK to resolve remaining ambiguous or inconsistent labels. The agent can:

- Call Pinecone to compare embeddings across receipts
- Query DynamoDB for past receipt structure
- Apply logical rules (e.g., label propagation across lines)
- Chain multiple reasoning steps before finalizing a label

## AI Usage Tracking

This package includes comprehensive AI usage tracking with context manager patterns for automatic cost monitoring.

### Context Manager Patterns

```python
from receipt_label.utils import ai_usage_context, ai_usage_tracked

# Decorator for automatic tracking
@ai_usage_tracked(operation_type="receipt_processing")
def process_receipt(receipt_id: str):
    # Function is automatically tracked
    result = openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
    return result

# Context manager for complex operations
with ai_usage_context("batch_processing", job_id="job-123") as tracker:
    for receipt in receipts:
        process_receipt(receipt)
    # Metrics automatically flushed
```

### Features

- **Automatic tracking** via decorators
- **Context propagation** across function calls
- **Error recovery** - metrics flushed even on exceptions
- **Partial failure handling** for batch operations
- **Thread-safe** concurrent operations
- **< 5ms overhead** per operation

See [Context Manager Documentation](docs/context_managers.md) for detailed usage.

This stage is ideal for advanced logic, correction propagation, and multi-hop validation workflows.
