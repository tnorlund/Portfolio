# Smart Decision Engine

The Smart Decision Engine determines when pattern detection alone is sufficient for receipt labeling versus when GPT assistance is needed, targeting an 84% reduction in AI API costs.

## Overview

This engine implements a pattern-first strategy that:
- Analyzes pattern detection results for coverage and confidence
- Checks for essential labels (MERCHANT_NAME, DATE, GRAND_TOTAL)
- Leverages Pinecone for merchant-specific intelligence
- Makes intelligent decisions to minimize GPT usage while maintaining accuracy

## Architecture

### Phase 1: Baseline Implementation
- Core decision logic with static thresholds
- Essential labels enforcement
- Three-tier outcome system (SKIP/BATCH/REQUIRED)
- Feature flag support for safe rollout

### Phase 2: Spatial/Mathematical Detection System ✅ COMPLETED
- **81.7% cost reduction achieved** through pattern-first approach
- **Comprehensive spatial analysis** with enhanced price column detection
- **Mathematical validation** using subset sum algorithms for tax structure detection
- **Phase 2 features**: X-alignment tightness, font analysis, multi-column support
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms processing (33ms average) with 96.1% success rate
- **Smart AI decision**: Only call expensive services when pattern+spatial+math insufficient

### Phase 3: Production Optimization
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Continuous learning and feedback loops
- Advanced monitoring and analytics
- Production-scale deployment

## Usage

```python
from receipt_label.decision_engine import DecisionEngine, DecisionEngineConfig

# Initialize with configuration
config = DecisionEngineConfig(
    min_meaningful_words=5,
    min_coverage_percentage=90.0,
    require_essential_labels=True
)

engine = DecisionEngine(config, pinecone_client)

# Make decision after pattern detection
decision = await engine.decide(pattern_results, merchant_name)

if decision.action == DecisionOutcome.SKIP:
    # Use pattern-only results
    return finalize_pattern_labels(pattern_results)
elif decision.action == DecisionOutcome.BATCH:
    # Queue for batch GPT processing
    enqueue_for_batch_processing(receipt_id, unlabeled_words)
    return pattern_labels
else:  # REQUIRED
    # Immediate GPT processing needed
    gpt_response = await call_gpt_immediate(unlabeled_words)
    return merge_labels(pattern_results, gpt_response)
```

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Achievements ✅
- **81.7% cost reduction**: Process 4 out of 5 receipts without AI services
- **96.1% success rate**: High-quality spatial+mathematical detection
- **33ms average processing**: Sub-100ms performance target exceeded
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: 65 tests (58 unit + 5 integration + 2 performance)

### Phase 3 Targets
- **>85% cost reduction**: Further optimize with agentic AI approach
- **<100ms total latency**: Including potential AI service calls
- **Production monitoring**: Real-time performance and cost tracking
