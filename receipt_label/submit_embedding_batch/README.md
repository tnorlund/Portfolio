# Submit Embedding Batch

This module defines the core logic for preparing and submitting embedding batches to OpenAI's asynchronous Batch API. It is responsible for retrieving receipt word labels that have not yet been embedded, joining them with spatial OCR data, formatting the payload, and logging the batch submission.

This is typically the first step in a two-phase Step Function pipeline, followed later by a polling + processing step.

## ðŸ“¦ Functions

### `generate_batch_id()`

Generates a unique UUID for each embedding batch, used as a primary key in the `BatchSummary` and `EmbeddingBatchResult` tables.

### `join_labels_with_words(labels, words)`

Joins a list of `ReceiptWordLabel` and `ReceiptWord` entities by their composite key (`image_id`, `receipt_id`, `line_id`, `word_id`). This produces a merged dataset ready for embedding.

### `create_batch_summary(batch_id, joined)`

Builds a `BatchSummary` entity for the given embedding batch. This includes:

- Receipt references
- Word count
- Submission timestamp
- Batch type
- Placeholder OpenAI batch ID

## ðŸ§  Usage

This module is intended to be called from a Step Function or a job runner that:

1. Lists all receipt word labels with `validation_status = "NONE"`
2. Retrieves corresponding receipt word OCR data
3. Chunks the dataset into batches (e.g., 500â€“1000 items)
4. Writes each batch to NDJSON
5. Uploads the file to OpenAI's Batch API
6. Stores a `BatchSummary` with the submission metadata

The output of this module is a fully-formed batch job that can be polled and processed by the downstream polling workflow.
