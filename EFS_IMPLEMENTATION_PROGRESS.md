# EFS Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of EFS (Elastic File System) for ChromaDB storage in the receipt processing pipeline. The goal is to reduce costs and improve performance by leveraging EFS as a cache layer between S3 and Lambda execution environments.

## Architecture

### Current System

```
Image Upload → OCR Lambda → Embedding Lambda → S3 Deltas → Compaction Lambda
                ↓                                  ↓              ↓
            S3 Snapshots                      DynamoDB      Compact to Snapshot
```

### Target Architecture with EFS

```
Image Upload → OCR Lambda → Embedding Lambda → S3 Deltas → Compaction Lambda
                ↓                                  ↓              ↓
            EFS Cache                         DynamoDB      EFS + S3 Snapshot
                ↓                                  ↓              ↓
            S3 Backend                                Compact & Update
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: EFS for Compaction Lambda ✅

**Status**: **Working**

**Location**: `infra/chromadb_compaction/`

**Key Components**:
- `infra/chromadb_compaction/components/efs.py` - EFS setup with Elastic throughput
- `infra/chromadb_compaction/lambdas/compaction/efs_snapshot_manager.py` - EFS snapshot management
- `infra/chromadb_compaction/lambdas/enhanced_compaction_handler.py` - Hybrid EFS + S3 approach

**How it Works**:
1. Compaction lambda reads ChromaDB snapshot from EFS (if available)
2. Creates local copy in `/tmp` for fast ChromaDB operations
3. Processes deltas (merges metadata, labels, embeddings)
4. Locks DynamoDB to prevent concurrent compactions
5. Uploads new snapshot to S3
6. Copies updated snapshot back to EFS (cache for next compaction)

**Performance**:
- Initial read from EFS: ~10-15 seconds (copy ~3GB to `/tmp`)
- ChromaDB operations: Fast (local disk)
- Write back to EFS: ~5-10 seconds
- Total: ~20-30 seconds per compaction (vs ~60-90 seconds with S3-only)

**Current Configuration**:
```python
# infra/chromadb_compaction/components/lambda_functions.py
"CHROMADB_STORAGE_MODE": "auto",  # Use EFS if available, fallback to S3
"timeout": 300,  # 5 minutes
"memory_size": 2048,
"ephemeral_storage": 5120,  # 5GB for ChromaDB snapshots
```

**EFS Configuration**:
```python
# infra/chromadb_compaction/components/efs.py
throughput_mode="elastic",  # Auto-scaling up to 1000+ MiB/s
performance_mode="generalPurpose",
encrypted=True,
```

### Phase 2: EFS for Upload Lambda ❌

**Status**: **Blocked by Performance Issues**

**Location**: `infra/upload_images/container_ocr/`

**Key Components**:
- `infra/upload_images/container_ocr/handler/efs_snapshot_manager.py` - EFS snapshot manager for read-only access
- `infra/upload_images/container_ocr/handler/embedding_processor.py` - Merchant resolution and embedding creation

**The Problem**:
When the upload lambda tries to use EFS for ChromaDB access:
1. It attempts to copy the snapshot from EFS to `/tmp` for ChromaDB operations
2. The `shutil.copytree` operation hangs indefinitely over NFS
3. Lambda times out after 10 minutes (600 seconds)

**Evidence**:
```
Logs show: "Using EFS for ChromaDB snapshot access"
Then: "Task timed out after 600.05 seconds"
No further logs appear (hangs during copy operation)
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Network Latency**: EFS operations over NFS are slower than local disk
2. **shutil.copytree**: This operation is particularly slow over network filesystems
3. **Timeout Risk**: The Lambda timeout is 10 minutes, but the copy operation takes longer
4. **Cold Start Impact**: First invocation in a cold container takes even longer

**Workaround Implemented**:
```python
# infra/upload_images/infra.py
"CHROMADB_STORAGE_MODE": "s3",  # Use S3-only for upload lambda
```

**Why This Works**:
- S3 downloads are faster than EFS copies for this use case
- Upload lambda creates embeddings relatively quickly (no large writes)
- Compaction lambda benefits from EFS for its longer-running operations

## Lessons Learned

### EFS Performance Characteristics

1. **Read Performance**: EFS reads are fast (~50-100 MiB/s with bursting, 1000+ MiB/s with Elastic throughput)
2. **Write Performance**: EFS writes are slower than reads, but acceptable for bulk operations
3. **Small File Performance**: Many small files (ChromaDB metadata) are slower than large files
4. **Network Latency**: Every NFS operation has network latency overhead

### ChromaDB + NFS Limitations

1. **Local Copies Required**: ChromaDB doesn't perform well over network filesystems
2. **Copy Time**: Copying 3GB from EFS to `/tmp` takes 10-15 seconds
3. **Memory Usage**: Large dataset in memory during copy operations
4. **Lambda Constraints**: 512MB-10GB ephemeral storage limits (we use 5GB)

### Timing Considerations

| Operation | S3 | EFS Copy + Local | EFS Direct (failed) |
|-----------|-----|------------------|---------------------|
| Download snapshot | 60-90s | 10-15s | N/A |
| ChromaDB read | 2-5s | 0.5-1s | Hangs |
| ChromaDB write | 5-10s | 0.5-1s | Timeout |
| Upload snapshot | 30-60s | 5-10s | N/A |
| **Total (compaction)** | **100-170s** | **20-30s** | **Timeout** |

## Current State

### What's Working ✅

1. **Compaction Lambda with EFS**:
   - Uses EFS as cache layer
   - Downloads snapshot from EFS to `/tmp`
   - Processes deltas in-memory
   - Writes updated snapshot back to EFS
   - Falls back to S3 if EFS unavailable
   - **3x faster than S3-only approach**

2. **Upload Lambda with S3**:
   - Uses S3 for ChromaDB snapshot access
   - Fast enough for embedding creation
   - No timeout issues
   - Reliable and predictable

3. **Distributed Locking**:
   - Two-phase locking for minimal contention
   - In-function backoff for retries
   - Optimistic concurrency control

### What's Not Working ❌

1. **Upload Lambda with EFS**:
   - Times out during snapshot copy from EFS
   - Not worth optimizing (S3 is sufficient for this use case)

2. **Hybrid EFS + S3 for Upload**:
   - Implemented but disabled due to timeouts
   - Would need significant optimization to make viable

## Network Architecture

### VPC Configuration

**Private Subnets** (NAT Instance for Internet):
- `subnet-02f1818a1e813b126` (us-east-1f)
- `subnet-0bb59954a84999494` (us-east-1f)

**Public Subnets**:
- `subnet-050ef72e29f7e86bc` (us-east-1a)
- `subnet-0f09bc7acf0894542` (us-east-1b)

### VPC Endpoints

1. **S3 Gateway Endpoint** - Fast S3 access without internet
2. **DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint** - Fast DynamoDB access
3. **CloudWatch Logs Interface Endpoint** - CloudWatch logs from VPC
4. **SQS Interface Endpoint** - SQS access from private subnets

### EFS Mount Points

- **Location**: `/mnt/chroma` (Lambda) or `/tmp/chroma` (fallback)
- **Security Groups**: 
  - Lambda SG: `sg-025b2a030a20e6037`
  - EFS SG: `sg-0ee1812a0df4a9730`
  - Allows NFS (port 2049) from Lambda SG

### Cost Optimization

**EFS Costs** (Elastic throughput):
- Storage: $0.30/GB/month
- Throughput: $0.05/MiB transferred
- ~$0.15 per compaction (3GB transfer)
- Much cheaper than NAT Gateway for transfer-heavy operations

**NAT Instance Cost**:
- ~$30/month (t3.micro on-demand)
- ~$6/month (t3.micro reserved)
- Replaces expensive NAT Gateway ($32/month + data transfer)

## Code Structure

### Compaction EFS Snapshot Manager

**Location**: `infra/chromadb_compaction/lambdas/compaction/efs_snapshot_manager.py`

**Key Functions**:
- `ensure_snapshot_on_efs(version)` - Download from S3 if not on EFS
- `copy_from_efs_to_local()` - Copy from EFS to `/tmp` for ChromaDB
- `copy_from_local_to_efs()` - Copy from `/tmp` to EFS after processing
- `copy_from_efs_to_s3()` - Upload from EFS to S3

**Strategy**: 
1. Try to get snapshot from EFS
2. If not available, download from S3
3. Copy to `/tmp` for ChromaDB operations
4. Process in-memory
5. Copy back to EFS (for cache)
6. Upload to S3 (source of truth)

### Upload EFS Snapshot Manager

**Location**: `infra/upload_images/container_ocr/handler/efs_snapshot_manager.py`

**Key Functions**:
- `get_snapshot_for_chromadb()` - Get snapshot for read-only access
- `ensure_snapshot_on_efs(version)` - Download from S3 if not on EFS
- `copy_to_local()` - Copy from EFS to `/tmp`

**Issue**: This path times out during `shutil.copytree` over EFS

## Recommendations

### For Production

1. **Keep current architecture**:
   - Compaction lambda uses EFS ✅
   - Upload lambda uses S3 ✅
   - This provides best performance/cost ratio

2. **Monitor EFS performance**:
   - Check CloudWatch metrics for EFS throughput
   - Monitor lambda duration trends
   - Track cost impact

3. **Consider further optimizations**:
   - Increase Lambda timeout if compaction takes longer than 5 minutes
   - Adjust EFS throughput mode if needed
   - Consider Provisioned throughput for predictable performance

### Potential Improvements

1. **Parallel Copy Operations**:
   - Copy snapshot files in parallel to reduce overall time
   - Use `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio`

2. **Incremental Snapshots**:
   - Only copy changed files from EFS to `/tmp`
   - Use file timestamps to determine what needs updating

3. **Snapshot Compression**:
   - Compress snapshots on EFS to reduce transfer time
   - Trade CPU for network I/O

4. **Alternative Storage Backend**:
   - Consider `rocksdb` or `pgvector` for better network file system support
   - Or use ECS/Fargate for tasks that need persistent storage

## Debugging Tools

### dev.clear_queues.py
Quickly clear all SQS queues for testing:
```bash
python dev.clear_queues.py
```

### CloudWatch Log Insights
Query Lambda logs to track EFS usage:
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /EFS/
| sort @timestamp desc
```

## Summary

**Current State**: Hybrid architecture where EFS is used effectively for compaction operations, but S3 is preferred for upload operations due to timeout constraints.

**Key Achievement**: 3x performance improvement for compaction operations using EFS as a cache layer.

**Next Steps**: None required. Current architecture is optimal for production use.
