### Receipt and Receipt Merchant Validation

- [ ] Phase 1: Receipt-Level Merchant Validation
  - [ ] 1.1 Extract candidate fields from the receipt
  - [ ] 1.2 Call Google Places API
  - [ ] 1.3 Validate match with GPT (optional but powerful)
  - [ ] 1.4 Write ReceiptMetadata entity to DynamoDB
  - [ ] 1.5 Update receipt context - Add to DynamoDB entities. Not sure if this is necessary
- [ ] Phase 2: Word-Level Label Validation
  - [ ] 2.1 Reconstruct embedding input string (word text + label + position/confidence)
  - [ ] 2.2 Generate new embedding via OpenAI
  - [ ] 2.3 Query Pinecone for top 5 similar neighbors (merchant-scoped if possible)
  - [ ] 2.4 Send neighbors and word context to GPT for validation
  - [ ] 2.5 Parse GPT result: - decision: YES / NO / UNSURE - suggested_label (optional) - confidence score and reason
  - [ ] 2.6 Update ReceiptWordLabel in DynamoDB: - validation_status = VALIDATED, FLAGGED, or UNSURE - suggested_label and GPT justification
  - [ ] 2.7 Re-embed corrected labels if applicable
- [ ] Phase 3: Post-Validation Actions
  - [ ] 3.1 For VALIDATED labels: - Mark label as validated - Optionally mark Receipt as partially/fully validated
  - [ ] 3.2 For FLAGGED or corrected labels: - Remove original vector from Pinecone - Update label in DynamoDB (if corrected) - Re-embed the corrected label and upsert to Pinecone - Track correction history for auditability
  - [ ] 3.3 For UNSURE labels: - Flag for human review - Optionally write to a “review queue” DynamoDB table
  - [ ] 3.4 For receipt-level metadata: - Update `Receipt` entity with merchant_id and validation confidence - Record GPT confidence and justification for match
